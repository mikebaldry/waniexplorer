  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to support</vocabulary> someone. In order to support them, you grab two saws. One saw and another saw. It's a <reading>saw saw</reading> (ささ) combination good enough to do all the supporting you need - and maybe cut some supports too.",
