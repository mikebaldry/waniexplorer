  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>new</kanji> <kanji>lodge</kanji> area is <vocabulary>Shinjuku</vocabulary>, a popular district in Tokyo. Perhaps there are many places to stay in Shinjuku. Either way, you should visit, it's fun! It will help if you've heard of Shinjuku before, too. Do some research about Shinjuku if you've never heard of it.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just be careful of the しゅく changing to じゅく. Once again, will help if you've heard of Shinjuku.",
