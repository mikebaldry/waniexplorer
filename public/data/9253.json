Like connect people, hold hands, connect a cable to a charger, etc.\n\nFiguratively, when you want to connect something over time, like a conversation, then you want <vocabulary>to maintain</vocabulary> something over time as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you already know from the kanji.",
