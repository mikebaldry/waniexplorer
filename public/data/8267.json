  "meaningMnemonic": "The person everyone comes to a <kanji>mutual</kanji> agreement about to be the <kanji>manager</kanji> of the country is the <vocabulary>Prime Minister</vocabulary>.\n\nCompared to 首相 or 総理大臣 that you've learned as \"prime minister\" previously, 宰相 were prime ministers appointed by monarchs. So this is a bit of a dated term used for the prime ministers of an imperial or royal court.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You already know both readings, but make sure to read 相 as しょう. This should be easy to remember since <reading>Sho</reading>guns (しょう) were like prime ministers back in the day!",
