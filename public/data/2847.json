That means they share meanings as well.\n\n地 is often used in formal contexts or literature to refer to the <vocabulary>Earth</vocabulary>'s surface, the <vocabulary>ground</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>land</vocabulary> in a more abstract or overarching sense. To say \"earth\" or \"ground\" casually, use 地面. For \"land,\" it's 土地.",
