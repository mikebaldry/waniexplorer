  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\n甲 has traditionally meant <vocabulary>turtle shell</vocabulary>, but these days it appears much more often in expressions like 足の甲 (<vocabulary>instep</vocabulary>) and 手の甲 (<vocabulary>back of the hand</vocabulary>). If you think about it, those body parts kind of resemble turtle shells, don’t you think?",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word is made up of a single kanji, but it uses the on'yomi reading, not the kun'yomi reading. Luckily, you've learned this reading already. Yay!",
