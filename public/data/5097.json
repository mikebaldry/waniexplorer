  "meaningMnemonic": "Ugh, that <kanji>field</kanji> <kanji>guy</kanji>. He's the worst. Always in the fields, making us look bad, quite the <vocabulary>bastard</vocabulary>. Really though, he's just this guy, but for some reason I sometimes don't like him.\n\nWhile 野郎 can be a casual term for a man, it's usually used to insult or show annoyance towards someone. So it's best to avoid using it unless you're really sure it's okay!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
