  "readingMnemonic": "You didn't learn this reading for 献 with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nI'm actually announcing the <vocabulary>menu</vocabulary> for <reading>con</reading>dors (こん). You thought I was going to tell you what's on the menu for humans? No no, that's a surprise. Condors need a heads-up for these things, because meals are extremely important to condors, given their size and everything.",
