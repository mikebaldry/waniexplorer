When you really feel fear, you think something is <vocabulary>terrifying</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>frightening</vocabulary> or even <vocabulary>dreadful</vocabulary>.\n\n恐ろしい can describe something that inspires deep fear or awe, often beyond normal feelings of fear. Since it can be used to create a dramatic or intense atmosphere, you might find 恐ろしい more often in literature.",
