  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that the kanji means <kanji>connection</kanji>. This is a verb, so one meaning is <vocabulary>to be connected</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to be involved</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to be related</vocabulary>. Basically things that have to do with being connected with something else.\n\nDoes this all sound familiar? In fact, this is another way to write 関わる, which you already learned! The two have exactly the same meaning, but this version is a bit less common.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. It's exactly the same as the reading for 関わる, so here's a reminder of that mnemonic to help you:\n\nRemember the \"<reading>Kaw Kaw</reading> (かか) Crow Gang\"? They are bad news, always eating from garbage and squawking \"kaw kaw\"... You don't want <vocabulary>to be involved</vocabulary> with them.",
