So, think about how you go inside this <vocabulary>cave</vocabulary>, only to find yourself covered by some red goopy liquid. You think it's blood, but luckily it just turns out to be <reading>ketsu</reading>p (けつ). If you want to be less formal, you can also use the kun'yomi and say ほらあな, but then you'd never learn that reading for 穴, and where's the fun in that?",
