  "primaryMeaning": "To Shoot",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>to attack</kanji>, but 撃つ means <vocabulary>to shoot</vocabulary>.\n\nThis can mean <vocabulary>to fire</vocabulary> a weapon such as a gun or to shoot a projectile, like an arrow. It can also mean to shoot a person or animal.",
  "primaryReading": "うつ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhat are you going <vocabulary>to shoot</vocabulary> at? <reading>U</reading>ni (う)! Why? Because this area is overrun with those black, spiky sea urchins. You need to cull them by shooting them down.",
