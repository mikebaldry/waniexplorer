  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nCurious about the difference between 蔵 and 倉? Traditionally, the 蔵 kanji was used for sturdy buildings that stored important items. This is where samurai kept their valuables! On the other hand, 倉 originally referred to places to store grain, and usually weren't as robustly made. They're basically interchangeable now, but the 蔵 kanji is more commonly used.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the other storehouse reading you learned earlier with 倉 and 庫. They're all basically the same thing, and lucky for you they share the same reading too (<reading>くら</reading>).",
