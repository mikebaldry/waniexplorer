  "meaningMnemonic": "The region of <kanji>darkness</kanji> in days of <kanji>old</kanji> referred to <vocabulary>Mongolia</vocabulary>. At least in China, where this word comes from. Imagine all those ancient Mongol tribes at the dark, unknown edges of China. Everything beyond the borders was shrouded in (figurative) darkness, I guess. No wonder they picked these kanji back then.",
