  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Think about what happens when you build something. What are you doing? You're standing it up. How do you say \"to stand\" in Japanese? <reading>た</reading>てる. That's the reading of this word as well. If you think about it they're similar!",
