  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>river</kanji> <kanji>juvenile</kanji>... not what you think. It's a <vocabulary>kappa</vocabulary>, a mythological Japanese creature. That being said, it lives in / around rivers and is about the size of a juvenile, so maybe this makes sense.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 河 makes sense. The reading for 童 however is weird. Since the meaning is \"kappa\" though you can use that to remember the reading as well. If you don't know what a kappa is do some research on the internets and figure out about them. It's interesting, and it will help you to remember this word.",
