  "meaningMnemonic": "You know the two words that make up this word, 行 and 列, and they both have similar meanings: a line and a row. Put them together and you have a <vocabulary>line</vocabulary> or a <vocabulary>queue</vocabulary>.\n\nThis usually means a line of people waiting for their turn, for example to enter a restaurant. It can be also used for a line that marches, like a line in a parade. In a mathematics context, it can refer to a <vocabulary>matrix</vocabulary>, which makes sense because they're lines and rows of numbers and stuff.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word takes the readings of the two words that make it up, so you should be lining up to read it!",
