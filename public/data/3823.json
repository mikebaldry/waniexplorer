The kanji itself means <kanji>rejoice</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to rejoice</vocabulary>. Though <vocabulary>to become happy</vocabulary> probably sounds a little more natural.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You start <vocabulary>to rejoice</vocabulary> by saying, \"<reading>Yo, rock on</reading> (よろこ)!\" Now you know how to rejoice from now on. At church or temple? \"Yo, rock on!\" Perfect.",
