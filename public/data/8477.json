  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you want <vocabulary>to make muddy</vocabulary>, meaning make yourself muddy, you should have your <reading>knee</reading>s <reading>go</reading> (にご) first. When you have your knees go first the mud splashes all over you but you don't hurt your hands or your butt doing it.",
