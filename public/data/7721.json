  "meaningMnemonic": "If you <kanji>decorate</kanji> your <kanji>spirit</kanji> with a bunch of pretty things like streamers and balloons, people will think you're just <vocabulary>showing off</vocabulary>. Yes, you know your spirit is awesome, but everyone else doesn't want it pushed in their face with your over the top decorations.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since the first part of this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You've learned how to read the かざ part already with the 飾る vocabulary.\n\nThe second kanji uses the on'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading for 気 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nAt the height of <vocabulary>showing off</vocabulary>, you bend one arm to your hip and the other out in the air. You pretend to be a <reading>ke</reading>ttle (け). You show off your spirit to all your friends singing \"I'm a little ke-ttle, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. EVERYONE LOOK HOW GREAT I AM!\" Your kettle dance is sure to impress them.",
