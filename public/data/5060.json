  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This refers to a literal edge, not a figurative one.\n\n端 refers to the <vocabulary>edge</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>end</vocabulary> of something, like the edge of a table, the far end of a bridge, or even the <vocabulary>corner</vocabulary> of a page.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: \n\nIf you're on <vocabulary>edge</vocabulary>, just eat some <reading>hash</reading> (はし) browns to feel better! And if you're going to the edge of the world, hash browns will probably help you make it there too. Hash browns are so useful!",
