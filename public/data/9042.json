This word has a slightly old-fashioned feel, and it's usually used for small villages in the countryside.\n\nIt's often combined with はなれた (separated) to talk about how far away from the nearest human habitation something is.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This jukugo uses the kun'yomi of the kanji instead of the more usual on'yomi. You learned both of these readings when you learned the vocabulary 人 and 里. Just notice that さと becomes ざと, because of rendaku.",
