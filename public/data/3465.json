Instead, you're guessing something and getting it right. So, this word means <vocabulary>to guess</vocabulary> something. Hopefully you don't have to guess too hard when it comes to the meaning of this word as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading can be remembered via the word 当たる which you learned a few levels ago. Use that knowledge to remember that this word is read as あてる. The important part is the あ.",
