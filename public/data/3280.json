  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>electricity</kanji> <kanji>wave</kanji> is a wave of electricity going through the air. There are many words you can use to describe this, but the easiest one is <vocabulary>reception</vocabulary> (like the reception on your phone, for example).\n\nOther more technical meanings are <vocabulary>radio wave</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>electromagnetic waves</vocabulary>. Which one you like is up to you, but reception is going to be the most common meaning on the street. Luckily people in Japan don't have AT&amp;T, otherwise you'd hear this word a lot more…",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The は from 波 rendakus to ぱ, so be careful. Maybe it's your <reading>pa</reading> who has bad reception every time you try to call him?",
