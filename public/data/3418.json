  "meaningMnemonic": "When you <kanji>exit</kanji> and <kanji>come</kanji>, apparently it means <vocabulary>to be able to do</vocabulary>. I think of it like you're leaving a location (出) to do a task and then you come (来る) back after you did it. Perhaps you were waiting in a room training like someone from Dragonball. When you leave the room, you are ready to fight the enemy and win. You train in that room <vocabulary>to be able to do</vocabulary> whatever you need to do, and only leave and come back alive because you were able to do it.\n\nThis verb is really common and it has a wide range of meanings. It can also mean things like <vocabulary>to be ready</vocabulary>, for example a meal, and <vocabulary>to be made</vocabulary>, for example when saying what something is made from. It's commonly written in hiragana, but you'll see the kanji version too!",
  "primaryReading": "できる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are a bit strange. They're both kun'yomi readings, where 出 is で and 来る is きる. This is different from the reading you originally learned with 来る (くる), though, so be careful. If you can remember that and remember the kun'yomi readings from the previous vocab, you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.",
