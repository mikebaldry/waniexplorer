  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're waiting inside. The <vocabulary>remainder</vocabulary> of your forces are out there, fighting. You don't know who will survive... or if they even will. You have a secret <reading>knock</reading> (のこ), though, that you use to find out if it's one of the remaining forces outside or the enemy, broken through. You hear a knock. What is it? Is it your men or theirs? Imagine it out, focusing on the knock conversation that happens between you and the remainder.",
