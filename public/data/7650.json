  "meaningMnemonic": "When you <kanji>value</kanji> <kanji>status</kanji> you really care about the <vocabulary>price</vocabulary> of things. And usually the higher the <vocabulary>value</vocabulary>, the higher the <vocabulary>cost</vocabulary>.\n\n価格 refers to something's market value, or to product pricing in a broader sense. It's sort of a formal word, so you might see it on fliers or in business and economic discussions about pricing strategies, for example.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.",
