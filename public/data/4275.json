When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're having this crazy <vocabulary>dream</vocabulary>. The dream allows you to do anything you want. Every time you ask \"hey, can I do this?\" The answer is always \"<reading>you may</reading>\" (ゆめ). Think of some things you'd want to do if you could do anything. Ask permission and get this answer in your imagination.",
