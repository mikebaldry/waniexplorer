  "meaningMnemonic": "This is like saying \"when it comes to the 何故,\" which means you're giving a reason, making this <vocabulary>because</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>the reason is</vocabulary>, followed by… whatever you wanna say! \n\nNote that this is a quite formal way to say \"because,\" so you'll mostly encounter this in writing or formal speech, and almost always at the beginning of a sentence in Japanese.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This reading is an exception but you learned them already because they're the same as the word 何故, which you learned a few levels ago. It just has some kana attached to it!",
