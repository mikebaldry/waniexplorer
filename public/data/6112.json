  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nWhen 陣 means <vocabulary>army camp</vocabulary>, it's mostly used in historical contexts to refer to troop formations or encampments. It's not used for modern army camps, but you'll probably see it in connection with samurai battles. It's even used in dodgeball to talk about the enemy's side of the court.\n\nIn modern Japanese, 陣 is commonly used as a suffix to mean a <vocabulary>corps</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>group</vocabulary> of people engaged in some activity together, like 報道陣 (the press corps) or 教授陣 (a group of professors, i.e. the faculty).",
