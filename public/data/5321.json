You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe one with the <vocabulary>flag</vocabulary> is the Mad <reading>Hatter</reading> (はた). Just imagine looking through a group of people. You have to find the Mad Hatter, and he has to find you. That's why he offered to wear a flag on his hat.",
