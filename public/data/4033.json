  "meaningMnemonic": "When how much you <kanji>prosper</kanji> goes into your <kanji>heart</kanji> and just enters a <kanji>void</kanji>, it will rarely mean anything to you. A person who has this trait is going to have extreme <vocabulary>vanity</vocabulary> because he/she just needs to suck more and more prosperity into their bottomless pit of a heart. It's like a black hole. They need more and more and more so then they have to become vain.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
