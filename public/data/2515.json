  "meaningMnemonic": "This kanji has hiragana attached and ends with an い sound. That means it's probably an adjective (and it is!). So, if you take the kanji 小 and its meaning (small), you can figure out the adjective version of it. What is the adjective version of \"small?\" Actually, it's the same thing: <vocabulary>small</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "ちいさい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the ちい portion: \n\nWhen you think of the word <vocabulary>small</vocabulary>, try to think of this <reading>chee</reading>se (ちい) store. You go inside, and all of their cheeses are so small. They hand you a magnifying glass to see all the cheeses. You look at them and exclaim: \"Why are these cheeses so small???\"",
