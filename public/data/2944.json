  "meaningMnemonic": "Your future consists of <kanji>certain</kanji> <kanji>death</kanji>. How would you feel in this situation? Probably very <vocabulary>frantic</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>desperate</vocabulary>. \n\nAnother translation for this word is simply <vocabulary>certain death</vocabulary>, though I'd rather you learn one of the first two before this one if you can.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are the on'yomi readings, though 必 (ひつ) gets shortened to ひっ. In your <vocabulary>desperate</vocabulary> situation just imagine that you're trying to get out of it, and to do so you move the つ only to find a smaller っ blocking your way. It is certain death.",
