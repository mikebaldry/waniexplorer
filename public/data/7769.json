  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>narrow</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to narrow something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to narrow down something</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou have <vocabulary>to narrow</vocabulary> the width of something. The only way you can do that is to <reading>sever</reading> (せば) off each end. Maybe you're trying to get a sofa up a tight stairway. The only way to do that is by severing off each arm to narrow it.",
