  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>retreat</kanji>, and this verb version is when you make something retreat. In other words, it means <vocabulary>to repel something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to dismiss something</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to reject something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You repel something, like bad luck. You reject something, like a proposal.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You learned this with its intransitive pair verb 退く, but here's a mnemonic just in case:\n\nRemember the re-zoner? Well, <vocabulary>to repel</vocabulary> bad luck, <reading>she, re-zo</reading>ned (しりぞ) the whole place. No bad luck allowed inside the zone.",
