  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>public</kanji> <kanji>announcement</kanji> is a <vocabulary>public notice</vocabulary>.\n\n公告 looks and sounds a lot like 広告, but the meanings are different. You might remember 広告 is for advertisements, but 公告 here is for the kind of official statements that companies or governments put out for the public, especially shareholders, creditors, or other stakeholders.\n\nYou can remember 公告 is a public notice because the kanji for \"public\" is 公, and it's not covered by a canopy like the other one. It's uncovered, all out in the open for everyone to see — public!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
