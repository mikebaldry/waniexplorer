  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 動詞 means \"verb\"? When the verb's action happens by it<kanji>self</kanji> or to the subject itself, it's an <vocabulary>intransitive verb</vocabulary>.\n\nIn other words, it doesn't need a direct object to complete its action. These are verbs like  行く or  着く or  消える. They're doing something, but they're not doing it <em>to</em> anyone or anything. Can you think of other  自動詞 in Japanese?",

  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
