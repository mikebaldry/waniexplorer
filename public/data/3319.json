When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou may have the ability to <vocabulary>taste</vocabulary> things now, but just wait until you get up there in <reading>age</reading> (あじ). You'll find that the tastes and flavors you once liked will become bland, and you'll need a lot of Sriracha to make things taste better.",
