  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji itself means <kanji>participate</kanji>, so you'd think this word would mean \"to participate\" but it's a little more complex than that. Think of it as \"to participate\" but where you have <vocabulary>to come</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to go</vocabulary> in order to do it. This is the humble way to say those things, so you're going to these places with your tail between your legs, just happy you can participate more than anything. By extension, this is also a humble way to say <vocabulary>to visit</vocabulary>, often used if you're visiting something sacred like a shrine or a tomb. \n\nHistorically, this word arose as a humble way to indicate visiting a person of higher social status. In a weird twist, this word has come to also mean <vocabulary>to be defeated</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be at a loss</vocabulary>. Think of it as what can happen when you're trying to participate while in an inferior position to someone or something. ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You get <vocabulary>to come</vocabulary> to participate! \"It's <reading>my</reading> (まい) lucky day!\" you exclaim.",
