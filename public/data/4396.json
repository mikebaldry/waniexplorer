  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 動詞 means \"verb\"? When the verb is done to some <kanji>other</kanji> thing, it's a <vocabulary>transitive verb</vocabulary>.\n\nThat means it takes a direct object. Verbs like 食べる, 使う, and 上げる are transitive verbs because they need a direct object, an \"other\" thing, to receive their action.",
