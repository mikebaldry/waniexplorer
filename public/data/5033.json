  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\n暇 means the <vocabulary>spare time</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>free time</vocabulary> you have when you're <vocabulary>not busy</vocabulary> with work, school, or other obligations. It can also indicate a slow period for a business or a time when you have nothing to do, often suggesting a sense of boredom.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: \n\nIn your <vocabulary>spare time</vocabulary> you like to drink <reading>hima</reading> (ひま), an off brand version of Zima.",
