Here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading for 愛:\n\nIf you ask anyone outside of <vocabulary>Ehime Prefecture</vocabulary> what they think of princesses they'll respond with, \"<reading>Eh</reading>\" (え). They don't really care either way. If someone from Ehime heard that they'd says, \"EH? EH?! Princesses are the BEST!\"",
