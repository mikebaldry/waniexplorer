  "meaningMnemonic": "When your <kanji>belly</kanji> has <kanji>decreased</kanji> in the amount of stuff inside it, you become <vocabulary>hungry</vocabulary>.\n\n腹が減った is a casual way of saying <vocabulary>I'm hungry</vocabulary> in Japanese, often with a bit of a rough or masculine tone.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is 腹 plus 減る put together. With these two combined, you have はらがへった.\n\nIn casual speech, you might hear 腹減った without the が more often. The version with が is more common in writing or fixed expressions like 腹が減っては戦ができぬ (you can't fight on an empty stomach).",
