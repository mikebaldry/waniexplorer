Yum yum!",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Nice! This kanji is the same as the radical that looks just like it (down to the meaning, even!). The radical is <radical>nine</radical> and the kanji is <kanji>nine</kanji>, making the meaning of this kanji really easy to remember as long as you know the radical first.",
