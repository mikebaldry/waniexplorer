  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>chirp</kanji> but the verb has the broader meaning <vocabulary>to make an animal sound</vocabulary>. Variations of this include <vocabulary>to bark</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to chirp</vocabulary>, but this can be used for any animal sound.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji. So, spend more time chirping and less time memorizing, okay?",
