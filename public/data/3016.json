  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nYou've been assigned the <vocabulary>important task</vocabulary> of taking care of the local <reading>tie</reading> <reading>yak</reading>s (たいやく). Where you're from, tie-wearing yaks are incredibly important, so don't take this great duty lightly!",
