  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nWhile 一人 simply means \"one person,\" 独り carries a stronger sense of being <vocabulary>alone</vocabulary>, often with connotations of <vocabulary>solitude</vocabulary>. It can also mean someone is <vocabulary>single</vocabulary> (as in not married). ",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is different from the one you learned (this is kun'yomi). There's an easy way to remember it, though. 一人 and 独り share the same readings and mean almost the same thing. Just try to remember that this ひとり is used to emphasize solitude.",
