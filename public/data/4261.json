  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>overthrow</kanji> or <kanji>collapse</kanji>, and this verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in す, so you are doing those things to something else. So, this verb means things like <vocabulary>to knock over</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to knock down</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>to bring down</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word can be used to talk about physically knocking something over, as well as bringing something or someone down, like a government.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You use the power of the <reading>Tao</reading> (たお) to do all of your knocking down. Imagine yourself contemplating Tao philosophy, then using those pleasant thoughts to knock everything over around you. BLAM!",
