  "meaningMnemonic": "When you think of a <kanji>fur</kanji> <kanji>insect</kanji> what do you think of? My mind immediately goes to a <vocabulary>caterpillar</vocabulary>. Imagine the furriest caterpillar you can and touch it. How does it feel? Furry?",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings for this word are strange. Both use the kun'yomi readings - 虫 uses the reading you learned with the kanji, so that's easy. The 毛 part is like the vocab word 毛 you learned in the previous lesson.",
