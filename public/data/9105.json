  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji, which you already know. However, 馬 uses a bit of a special reading here: め. So here’s a mnemonic to help you remember this: \n\nThis <vocabulary>fast horse</vocabulary> is so fast that all you can see whenever it speeds past you are its shiny bright <reading>目</reading> (め). Imagine this fast horse zooming past you over and over, but all you ever see are its white 目.",
