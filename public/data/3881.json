  "meaningMnemonic": "You've seen that 消す is \"to extinguish.\" So, this is another verb version of that. This time, you're not doing the extinguishing, it's just happening. Something is going <vocabulary>to disappear</vocabulary> on its own. How can you differentiate this from 消す? Well, える allows you to notice how the object disappeared into thin <reading>air</reading> (える). You know you didn't do it, so it disappeared on its own, making it <vocabulary>to disappear</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is different from 消す, unfortunately, so you can't use that. Just think about how after the object in front of you disappears you use a <reading>key</reading> (き) to open an invisible door. That's where everything's disappearing to! You see all your disappeared stuff on the other side of this invisible door which you opened with a magical <reading>key</reading>.",
