  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Biased",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>biased</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to be biased</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be prejudiced</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "かたよる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou meet someone who claims <vocabulary>to be biased</vocabulary> about everything. You ask them why and they say, \"I'm a <reading>cutter, yo</reading> (かたよ)! I cut everything in half and only like one of 'em. But I guess if you wanna call that biased go ahead, man.\" Huh okay.",
