  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this one is a weird one. It uses the kun'yomi readings for both, meaning you'll have to pull your knowledge of the word 弱い from earlier and apply it here. 虫 should be okay, though, as this is the reading you learned with the kanji.\n\nJust remember, only weak bugs use kun'yomi, and that weak bug is you in this instance.",
