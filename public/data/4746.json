  "meaningMnemonic": "A certain <kanji>limit</kanji>’s <kanji>degree</kanji> is how far it can go. It’s the <vocabulary>limit</vocabulary>; turn it up one more degree and it’s out of <vocabulary>bounds</vocabulary>. Keep it right where it is and it’s perfect.\n\nThis word refers to the maximum extent or range of something, beyond which it cannot be surpassed. While similar to 限界, 限度 often implies a predetermined acceptable or tolerable limit, while 限界 is more closely associated with an absolute or ultimate limit. ",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
