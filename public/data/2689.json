  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This word is actually more general than the English words <vocabulary>insect</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>bug</vocabulary>, though. It covers things like worms and spiders, too, so in that sense it's more like <vocabulary>creepy-crawly</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading, which is also the reading you learned when you learned this kanji!",
