  "readingMnemonic": "Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:\n\nEvery <vocabulary>eighth day</vocabulary> you have to buy <reading>yo</reading>gurt to fuel your <reading>ca</reading>r (ようか). Your car runs on yogurt, but it needs to be refilled every <vocabulary>eight days</vocabulary> to keep running. It's really inconvenient because it's just ONE day more than a week. And a week just feels better. Oh well.",
