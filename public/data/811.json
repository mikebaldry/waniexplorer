The methodic thump thump thumping of a heart puts me in a trance that gives me great ideas. It’s a very inspirational sound, the sound of a heart is. It gives me an idea. \n\nAlternatively, you could look at this kanji and see a \"stand\" radical and something that kind of (almost) looks like the kanji for \"think.\" When you stand up and think, you come up with your very own <kanji>idea</kanji>s!",
