It seems to have injected itself into American and English culture a decent amount, anyways. If you are one of the lucky ones, you'll know that this word is read as かわいい. If you're not, think of the cute thing being a cow. Then you say, \"that <reading>cowはいい</reading>\" (かわいい), or \"that cow is good\" because it's so cute.",
