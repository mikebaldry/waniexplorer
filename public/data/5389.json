  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n\nThere's something inside and you wanna get to what's within. Look inside. <reading>Ooh, chee</reading>se (うち)! Your favorite. Ooh cheese, how I love you.",
