  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>bathe</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to bathe in</vocabulary>.\n\nThis verb is transitive, and the object is whatever you're \"bathing in\". It could be a bath or a shower, but it could also be the sun. So you can both シャワーを浴びる and 日の光を浴びる. More negatively, this can also mean <vocabulary>to be exposed to</vocabulary> something, such as criticism or radioactivity.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You want to know the best way <vocabulary>to bathe in</vocabulary> something? With a bunch of <reading>a</reading>ardvarks (あ) in the water. They use their sticky little tongues to clean all your cracks and crannies.",
