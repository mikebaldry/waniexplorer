  "primaryMeaning": "To Arrange Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember 揃う, \"to be complete\"? This is the transitive version of that, and it means things like <vocabulary>to arrange something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to gather something</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>to align something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis one is a little tricky to understand and translate well. At its core, this verb describes the act of arranging all of the necessary things for something. But it can also describe aligning certain things in a uniform, matching manner. If this still isn't clear, have a careful look at our context sentences and collocations!",
  "primaryReading": "そろえる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You already know this, so you're all good here!",
