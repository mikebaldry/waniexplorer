  "readingMnemonic": "Unfortunately, the <kanji>author</kanji> is allergic to flowers. They are only allergic to touching them though, so the author is holding the flowers with a pair of <reading>cho</reading>psticks (ちょ), really close to their face. Using the chopsticks, they can still use the flowers to think of fancy, author-ly words without touching them.",
