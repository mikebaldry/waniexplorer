Cookies don't fall apart in the wind, and everyone loves cookies, alive or dead. You replace the stems with the cookies and everything looks a lot nicer.",
  "meaningMnemonic": "When you leave <radical>flowers</radical> on a <radical>tombstone</radical> they look good at first, but after a few days or some harsh weather, there's nothing left but <kanji>stem</kanji>s. That's why you have to replace flowers on tombstones all the time. If you don't it will look like you only left the stems there, and that's pretty disrespectful.",
