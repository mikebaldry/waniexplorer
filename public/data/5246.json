  "meaningMnemonic": "The 日 refers to \"Japan\" (It's the 日 of 日本). So, you have Japan and <kanji>Europe</kanji>, which makes this <vocabulary>Japan and Europe</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>Japanese-European</vocabulary>.\n\n日欧 is a fairly formal word commonly found in newspapers or official reports, where it’s often used for brevity when referring to Japan and Europe together, like in 日欧関係 (Japanese-European relations).",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
