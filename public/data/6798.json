  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nKeep in mind that 俺 has a more informal and masculine sound than neutral options like 私 and 僕. While it carries a rougher vibe, it's not solely reserved for tough personalities and is very common in casual chats among buddies.",
