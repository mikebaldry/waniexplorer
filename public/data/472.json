  "meaningMnemonic": "The combination of radicals for this kanji may not be obvious at first, but if you look carefully you'll see it. The <radical>lid</radical> is inside the <radical>head</radical> for this kanji because it's holding something in. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of <kanji>yen</kanji> coins, the currency of Japan!",
