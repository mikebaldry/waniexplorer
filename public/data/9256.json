That substitute money is the <vocabulary>cost</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>price</vocabulary> of the thing you're paying for.\n\nThere are a lot of money-related synonyms in Japanese, but keep in mind this one refers to the money you pay to get some stuff in return (usually goods), not to an expense, price, or value. It's \"substitute money\" after all!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which means it uses on'yomi readings for both of the kanji. You already know those, so you should be good to go!",
