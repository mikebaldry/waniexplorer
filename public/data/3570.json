  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Wind</kanji> of the <kanji>gods</kanji>. These are <vocabulary>divine winds</vocabulary>. More popularly, this is a word known as <vocabulary>kamikaze</vocabulary>, which became known because of the kamikaze pilots during WWII. This was used before WWII, though, when the entire Mongol fleet was destroyed by a storm, preventing an invasion of Japan. How lucky.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are kun'yomi readings for both, probably because this is two words put together into one. You know the reading of 風 from previous levels, hopefully. Now all you need to do is apply your knowledge of the word 神 to be able to read the rest.",
