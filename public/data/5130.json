  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\n券 is a standalone word that means <vocabulary>ticket</vocabulary>, but it's commonly used as a suffix to form words like 入場券 (admission ticket), 割引券 (discount <vocabulary>coupon</vocabulary>), or 定期券 (commuter <vocabulary>pass</vocabulary>).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Usually it's attached to things, because it tells you what kind of ticket something is.",
