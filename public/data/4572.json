  "meaningMnemonic": "So this doesn't quite make sense in terms of the meaning of the kanji... but you'll be okay. This means <vocabulary>on purpose</vocabulary>. Perhaps when you do something that has the <kanji>appearance</kanji> of doing what you wanted to do, you're doing it on purpose.\n\n態と is usually written in kana in modern writing, but you'll occasionally see it in kanji too.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \"You did that to me <vocabulary>on purpose</vocabulary>? <reading>Whaza</reading>pp with that?\"",
