  "meaningMnemonic": "You'll have to learn this word in two parts. You already know the meaning of 今 because of the kanji, which means \"now.\" The すぐ part, however, is a new word, meaning \"soon.\" すぐ and \"soon\" even start with a similar sound, so maybe that can help you remember this! If you put 今 and すぐ together, you get \"now soon.\" Put in better English, that's <vocabulary>at once</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>right now</vocabulary>.",
