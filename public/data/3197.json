  "meaningMnemonic": "If you think about it, an <kanji>earth</kanji> <kanji>road</kanji> isn't going to be the main road. It will be the road less traveled. You could call it a <vocabulary>path</vocabulary> (you know, like a dirt path!) or a <vocabulary>dirt road</vocabulary>. Alternatively, another less traveled street that would probably be made out of dirt back in the day (before everything was paved) would be an <vocabulary>alley</vocabulary>. Imagine yourself walking down a dirt alley at night with no shoes. Scary!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You've learned these readings already, so you should be able to read this word too! And remember, that it's the じ reading that you learned with 生地 here. ",
