  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>construct</kanji> and the verb version is <vocabulary>to build something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to construct something</vocabulary>.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou want <vocabulary>to build something</vocabulary> called a <reading>key zoo</reading> (きず). Which is a zoo for keys instead of animals. So it's a bunch of keys in cages, basically. Hmm, how artsy of you... Hopefully people get it. Isn't it a bit avant-garde <vocabulary>to construct something</vocabulary> like a key zoo?",
