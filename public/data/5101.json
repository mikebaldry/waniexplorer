  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Long</kanji> <kanji>shoes</kanji> aren't long in that the feet part are long (that wouldn't make sense). Instead, the top part is long to keep you dry when it's raining. Yes, these are <vocabulary>rain boots</vocabulary>.\n\nIn modern Japanese, 長靴 is most commonly used to mean rain boots or <vocabulary>rubber boots</vocabulary>. It can occasionally mean <vocabulary>riding boots</vocabulary> as well. But if you're referring to fashion boots or boots in general, you can just call them ブーツ.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is a bit weird. Double kun'yomi, so think along the lines of 長い and 靴 getting added together. 靴 is the reading you learned with the kanji, however. It also gets rendaku'd.",
