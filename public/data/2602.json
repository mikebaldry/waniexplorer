Just imagine a couple samurai squaring off, then charging, then making one big cut. It's the most important thing they'll do in their lives (if they live!).",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nIt's extremely <vocabulary>important</vocabulary> to keep your <reading>tie</reading>s in <reading>sets</reading> (たいせつ). If you don't arrange them neatly in sets, the tie police might just come knocking at your door and take you with them!",
