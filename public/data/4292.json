  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this word is a bit of an exception. You kind of already know the reading for 尻 from the kun'yomi しり you learned already. Here it gets shortened to しっ. The reading for 尾 is totally different from what you learned, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe animal with the best <vocabulary>tail</vocabulary> in the world is the <reading>po</reading>lar (ぽ) bear. They're stubby and white and cute. Only polar bears have tails like that!",
