  "meaningMnemonic": "If something does <kanji>not</kanji> <kanji>shake</kanji>, it’s probably in <vocabulary>a slump</vocabulary>. If nothing’s shaking, things must be <vocabulary>sluggish</vocabulary>.\n\n不振 is used for times when things are slower or worse than usual. For example, 業績不振 is when a business isn’t doing as well as it usually does, and 食欲不振 is when you don't feel like eating as much as you normally would.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
