But this often isn't just any iron plate. If you could guess from the reading, it's often used in cooking as an <vocabulary>iron griddle</vocabulary>, or a <vocabulary>teppan grill</vocabulary>. Ever heard of Teppanyaki?\n\nFiguratively, it means a <vocabulary>sure thing</vocabulary> or a practically guaranteed success. For example, you can use 鉄板 for a racehorse almost certain to win, or a joke that consistently gets big laughs.",
