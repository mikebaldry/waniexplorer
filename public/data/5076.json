  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are 腹 plus 立つ put together. The たつ becomes だつ as a standard reading though.\n\nWhile はらだつ is the standard reading for 腹立つ, it's usually found in more formal settings or writing. You'll probably hear はらたつ more often in everyday conversations, as it’s a shorter, more colloquial way of expressing 腹が立つ!",
