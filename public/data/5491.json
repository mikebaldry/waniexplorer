  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>rich</kanji> so the verb vocab version would be <vocabulary>to be rich in</vocabulary>.\n\n富む is a formal word that's commonly used in writing. While it can refer to material wealth, it's more commonly used figuratively to describe an abundance of qualities, a place rich in nature or specific resources, or emotional richness or fulfillment.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Think about the richest person you know. That person is <reading>Tom</reading> (とむ). Imagine Tom as being super rich. If you don't know a Tom, think of a famous Tom, like Tom Cruise, who definitely is pretty rich.",
