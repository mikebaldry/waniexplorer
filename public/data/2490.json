  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>above</kanji> and this verb is related to that meaning. It means <vocabulary>to lift something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to raise something</vocabulary>. It's a transitive verb, meaning that you do something to something else. You raise something. Like your hands!",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you want <vocabulary>to lift something</vocabulary>, you always shout \"<reading>Ah</reading>!\" (あ) to get the extra power you need. Especially when you want to lift something over your head. Go ahead, try it now. Lift something up and shout \"Ah!\" Feels good, right? ",
