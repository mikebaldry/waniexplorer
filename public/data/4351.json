  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>steam</kanji> <kanji>car</kanji> is a car that runs on steam. No regular car runs on steam, but what thing that has things called \"cars\" does run on steam? How about a <vocabulary>steam train</vocabulary>? You can also think about 電車s, which are electric cars (but means \"train\"). This is similar to that, but now it's run with steam, making it a steam train.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
