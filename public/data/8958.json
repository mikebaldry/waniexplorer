  "meaningMnemonic": "You've hopefully already learned that 力 means \"power.\" You might have also heard the word いっぱい, because it's used a lot in conversation. It has a few meanings (you'll learn more of them later) but the important one here is \"full\" or \"a lot.\" Put these two words together and you have <vocabulary>full power</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>with all one's strength</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>as hard as one can</vocabulary>. Remember this one with all your strength!\n\nJust a side note: いっぱい can also be written in kanji, which you'll learn later on! However, in simple words like this one it's usually written in kana.",
  "readingMnemonic": "力 uses the same reading as you learned with the vocabulary. That's because this is basically two separate words stuck together.",
