  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that the kanji refers to a <kanji>floor</kanji> (as in the \"fifth floor\"). This word represents the version that comes after a number, shown with a 〜. Essentially, this has the same meaning as the kanji you learned, making it nice and easy.\n\nNote that floor-counting systems can vary across different countries. In Japan the ground floor is generally called 一階, with the floors above being 二階, 三階, and so on.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Don't type in the 〜 or you'll get it wrong!",
