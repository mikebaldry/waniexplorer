It's in everything you hear!\n\nMore broadly, this can refer to a whole genre of Japanese pop music from the Showa era. In other words, it refers to <vocabulary>retro J-POP</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>Showa-era pop music</vocabulary>. The word <vocabulary>kayokyoku</vocabulary> is sometimes used for it in English too.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.",
