  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>sky</kanji> <kanji>interval</kanji> is an area of the sky. In places that are just empty sky, there is only <vocabulary>space</vocabulary>. Of course, not technically... there's something there, but back in the day when kanji was being made, nobody knew that. This word can mean both space in regards to outer space as well as the space around you in your room.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
