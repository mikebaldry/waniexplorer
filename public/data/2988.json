  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>black</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>black</vocabulary>. Special Note: The noun version of black also exists in Japanese. It is just 黒 with the same pronunciation, but minus the い which makes it adjective-tastic.",
  "primaryReading": "くろい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThink of black things. One very common black thing is the common <reading>crow</reading> (くろ). Associate those two together.",
