  "meaningMnemonic": "This counter is used with some kind of <kanji>machine</kanji> or device, usually a fairly large one (so nothing itty bitty). Cars are a good example of this. But it can also be used for things like computers, which were once the size of rooms, but are now nice and small. Thanks technology!",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Be sure to omit the 〜 in your answer as it is only a placeholder for a number.",
