You'll still see references to it everywhere, though, so it's good to learn. You can also call this <vocabulary>Tokyo</vocabulary> if you want, but I'd prefer if you answered \"Edo,\" instead.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji. Of course, it will be easy if you know the word <vocabulary>Edo</vocabulary> already.",
