  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>poem</kanji> <kanji>song</kanji> is <vocabulary>poetry</vocabulary>. It's not quite a song but I think you can make the connection.\n\n詩歌 used to be for two kinds of poetry called kanshi and waka, but nowadays it's also used for other traditional Japanese poetry forms like tanka, haiku, senryu, and more.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You know these readings, but there's usually an extra い in the middle. Don't worry, しか is totally fine too, but しいか is more common. You got this!",
