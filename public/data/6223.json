  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>escape</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to escape</vocabulary>. Also, it can be <vocabulary>to flee</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to run away</vocabulary>. Basically, if you're trying to get away from someone or something, you could be doing this.\n\n逃げる is a general word for escaping that can be used in any situation, from running away from danger, to avoiding responsibility, to simply leaving a place quickly.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You are trying <vocabulary>to escape</vocabulary> from something chasing you, but you can't run fast because of your <reading>knee</reading> (に). You try to run, but it keeps holding you back. Feel the fear and pain of running with a hurt knee, and curse that knee of yours for holding you back.",
