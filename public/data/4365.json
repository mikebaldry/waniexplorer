  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji 達 pluralizes things sometimes. So, when you have a <kanji>plural</kanji> amount of a <kanji>person</kanji> you have more than one person, you have <vocabulary>people</vocabulary>.\n\nTake note! When using this word, you want to attach it to the type of \"people\" you are talking about. For example, あの人達 (those people over there). Other examples: 男の人達, その人達, 向こうの人達, etc. You don't use this by itself, instead you use it with something describing what kind of people you're talking about.",
