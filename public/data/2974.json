Though it may seem kind of strange that geography is bringing reason to the earth, if you think of geography as a study, then you can think about how you try to get reason through that, as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
