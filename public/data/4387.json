Well, combine them and you have a word for things you put on your feet, a.k.a. <vocabulary>footwear</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>shoes</vocabulary>.\n\nYou might know that 履く is used for lots of different clothes you wear below the waist, but be careful: <vocabulary>履き物</vocabulary> only refers to footwear and shoes.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is that of 履く and 物 put together. Just know those separately and you should be able to figure this one out as well.",
