  "meaningMnemonic": "You've got a combination of <kanji>China</kanji> and 揚げ, meaning \"fried.\" That makes this Chinese-style <vocabulary>Fried Chicken</vocabulary>, or as you'll probably also know it, <vocabulary>karaage</vocabulary>.\n\nWhile 唐揚げ most often refers to fried chicken, it can technically also refer to other deep fried meats, fish, or vegetables. As it's the most common meaning, remembering this as \"fried chicken\" will be just fine, though.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You know how to read the 揚げ part, but this uses the kun'yomi reading for 唐, which is new. You'll likely be able to remember this reading by associating fried chicken with Japanese karaage, but in case you're not familiar with it, here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nTo make this kind of <vocabulary>fried chicken</vocabulary>, you have to first give it one strong <reading>から</reading>て chop. If you fry it up without that からて chop, it just comes out terrible no matter what you do. So just remember that next time you make it for me, kay?",
