  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n\nLook up at that big, bright moon. You have to open it up and take what's inside. To do that, you are required to have <reading>two key</reading>s (つき), and they have to be turned at the same time. Imagine you and a friend both turning your keys on opposite sides of the moon to open up the center.",
