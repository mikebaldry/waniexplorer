  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is kind of weird, sorry. The reading for 葉 is the は you know and love. Then, 書 is かき despite not having a き on the end like you'd expect. So, it's weird. It's shortened like a postcard is a shortened letter, I suppose? Technically it is the 書き reading, but keep in mind that 書き gets rendaku'd.",
