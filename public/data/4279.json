  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Your <kanji>wife</kanji> does everything for you. She feeds you, she bathes you, she cleans up after you and even wipes your butt when you poop. Really, she is doing <reading>too mu</reading>ch (つま), and you should stop being a baby.",
