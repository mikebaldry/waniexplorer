The kanji itself means <kanji>trust</kanji>, but the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to ask for</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to rely on</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to request</vocabulary>. When you trust someone you can 頼む them, but only when you trust them. You put it in their hands. You trust them, after all.",
