  "meaningMnemonic": "Your body thinks you want to <kanji>substitute</kanji> <kanji>new</kanji> <kanji>exhibit</kanji>s inside yourself but it <kanji>apologize</kanji>s and replaces them more than you'd like. What it's actually doing is controlling your <vocabulary>metabolism</vocabulary>. Picture your body using food you eat by setting it up in an exhibit in your stomach. But it gets bored of it and wants to substitute it with a newer one, so it makes you hungry again, digesting the food fast.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You already know all of these, but 代 uses the less common たい reading, so here’s a mnemonic in case you’d like some help remembering that:\n\nAs everyone knows, the best way to boost your <vocabulary>metabolism</vocabulary> is to wear a <reading>tie</reading> (たい). They make your body more efficient overall, which includes your metabolism, so make sure you’re always wearing a tie for that metabolism boost!",
