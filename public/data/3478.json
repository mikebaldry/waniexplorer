  "meaningMnemonic": "Something that is double <kanji>weak</kanji> is probably pretty weak. You also know that this is an adjective because it ends with い. You know that 弱い is weak, so it probably isn't that. Instead, this one is <vocabulary>weak looking</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>frail</vocabulary>. If you know the grammar らしい you can kind of use that as a hint. The しい on the end reminds me of らしい which is like \"seems to be.\" So, \"seems to be weak\" = \"weak looking.\"",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is double kun'yomi, as you can probably guess due to all the hiragana involved. So, you double up on よわ and then add the しい to read this vocabulary word.",
