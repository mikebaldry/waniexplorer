Whenever you deal with and divide something, you’re preparing to dispose of it.\n\n処分 means getting rid of things you don’t want, like trash or old furniture. Sometimes, it can also mean <vocabulary>punishment</vocabulary>, like suspension from school for breaking the rules. This connection makes sense because both disposal and punishment involve handling something unwanted—whether it's an item or a behavior.",
