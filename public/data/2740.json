  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>mix</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to mix something</vocabulary>. \n\nIt’s transitive, so you’re doing the mixing.
