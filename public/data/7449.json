  "meaningMnemonic": "You are a 疲れ (tired) 様 (honorific that kind of refers to whoever's being mentioned). You say this to people when they've done good work — at the end of a workday or after a hard practice, for example. I guess the idea is that if they're tired, they've done some good work. Tell your coworkers お疲れ様でした when they leave for the day, or just use お疲れ in more casual situations with friends!",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading comes from 疲れ and 様, combined together into one word.",
