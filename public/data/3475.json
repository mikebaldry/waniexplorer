  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that the word 付ける means \"to attach\" and you know that the kanji 付 means <kanji>attach</kanji>. So, this word probably has something to do with attaching. This is the intransitive version, though, where something is attached (and you're not doing the attaching). You can use the く as a hint. You see something attached on the wall. You say \"Coo'\"",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading can be derived from 付ける, a word you should have seen a few levels ago. If you know that word's reading you should be able to figure out this word's reading as well (and vice versa).",
