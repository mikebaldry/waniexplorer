In fact, when someone reads a good piece of writing it changes them, and changes their culture too. What writing has changed you so much it has changed your culture and the way you act?",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 文 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nIn your <vocabulary>culture</vocabulary>, everyone drives <reading>bun</reading> <reading>car</reading>s (ぶんか). Indeed, bun cars are the height of culture. And because they're made out of buns, they're much less dangerous.",
