To remember the reading for 哀 imagine some <vocabulary>pathetic</vocabulary> person who lost their home. They may be <vocabulary>pitiful</vocabulary> but at some point after losing their home they decided that the hood of your car would make a fine place to live. You can't help but ask them, \"<reading>Why</reading> (わい) my car?\" There are so many other cars this pathetic person could be camping out on, but they chose yours.",
