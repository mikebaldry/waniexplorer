  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for the 大 part is actually the on'yomi reading you learned when learning this kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nWhen something's <vocabulary>great</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>important</vocabulary>, you'd better wear a <reading>tie</reading> (たい) for it. No showing up without a tie to anything that's a <vocabulary>big deal</vocabulary>, okay?",
