  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is a strange one, different from anything you've learned, kanji on'yomi or vocab kun'yomi. The reading is この, so think of this: \n\nWhat’s something easy <vocabulary>to be fond of</vocabulary>? <reading>子</reading>? <reading>No</reading> (この), not for you. You’re always saying “子? No!” Most people are fond of kids, at least their own, but not you. Noisy, germy, needy 子? No, no thank you!",
