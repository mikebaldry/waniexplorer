  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If something starts <vocabulary>to ripen</vocabulary> too much, it gets all gross, and you're all like, \"<reading>ew</reading> (う), that's gross.\"",
