  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Mail</kanji> (or <kanji>post</kanji>) has <kanji>convenience</kanji> because it is sent for you in the <vocabulary>mail</vocabulary> (or the <vocabulary>post</vocabulary>!).\n\n郵便 originally referred to the postal system, but eventually also came to refer to mail itself as a shorthand for 郵便物.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The reading for 便 here (びん) isn't the on'yomi you learned with the kanji though, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nYou get a lot of junk <vocabulary>mail</vocabulary>, so you throw it in the waste <reading>bin</reading> (びん). The waste bin is where that mail goes.",
