You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou want <vocabulary>to know</vocabulary> everything there is to know about <reading>sheep</reading> (し). Why? Because you are a busybody who wants to know everything. But for now, you'll settle for sheep. Right now all you know is that sheep are soft, come in many colors, and that they have 360 degree vision with their weird, rectangle eyes. There's even more to know, so you better get on it!",
