  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>fold</kanji> or <kanji>break</kanji>, so the vocab verb version is <vocabulary>to fold something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to break something</vocabulary>",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You <vocabulary>fold</vocabulary> your <reading>o</reading>bi (お) really carefully and put it away with the rest of your kimono.",
