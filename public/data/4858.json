  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>cut off</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is often used metaphorically to describe cutting off things that tie us down mentally or societally. This includes ending bad habits, so it also means <vocabulary>to quit doing something</vocabulary>.\n\nDon't confuse this with 断る which means \"to refuse.\" You know this is to cut off because of the つ, which hints that you have had <reading>two</reading> (つ) too many chocolates, and it's time to cut you off.",
  "readingMnemonic": "URGH! The reading isn't even the same as 断る, how frustrating. <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary> is read as たつ. Instead of eating too many chocolates and getting cut off, maybe you're eating too many tater <reading>tots</reading> (たつ). Don't eat so many of those, it's unhealthy. You have <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary> tater tots from your diet so you don't get fat.",
