  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\n\nBoth 市立 (municipal) and 私立 (private) are pronounced as しりつ and it's hard to tell them apart when speaking. Although they're not official readings, people sometimes distinguish 市立 and 私立 by pronouncing them as いちりつ and わたくしりつ respectively.",
