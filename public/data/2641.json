  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>task</kanji> or <kanji>use</kanji>. You can think of this verb as a more formal way to say <vocabulary>to use</vocabulary>, and that is <vocabulary>to utilize</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to learn the もち portion of もちいる: \n\nWhat will you <vocabulary>utilize</vocabulary> to get the job done? You have <reading>mochi</reading> (もち) in your hand, so you'll use that. Now go think of some kind of imaginary task you'll complete with mochi, making it as ridiculous as possible.",
