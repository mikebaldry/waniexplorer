That simply makes this <vocabulary>ten minutes</vocabulary>.\n\nNote that, as we mentioned on the page for 〜間, you can omit 間 and this will still mean <vocabulary>ten minutes</vocabulary>! You'll especially see this in conversations and more casual contexts.",
  "primaryReading": "じゅっぷんかん",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You do know all of those, but their behaviour is a little different here. 十 (じゅう) and 分 (～ふん) together actually turn into じゅっぷん here. This is sometimes the case when using ～分 to mean \"minute\" in combination with certain numbers, so try to pay attention to this!",
