  "readingMnemonic": "Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it actually uses kun’yomi readings. Think about this word this way:\n\nThis marks the <vocabulary>tenth day</vocabulary> since this <reading>talker</reading> (とおか) began talking non-stop. Talkers love talking, but this one is getting quite unbearable… Ten days of talking, can you believe it?\n\nNote that とお, generally pronounced \"toh\" with a long \"o\" sound, is not a common spelling, and you’ll only see it with a handful of kanji and vocabulary, like in this case. I mean, how often do you encounter a talker who can go on non-stop for ten days? That's pretty rare, right?",
