That is the verb version of this word, which means \"to pass through.\" So, if this is the noun version, what is it that you use to pass through something? To drive or walk along? That would be an <vocabulary>avenue</vocabulary> (or <vocabulary>street</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>road</vocabulary>, etc). This is a pretty common word in Japan, and good for not getting lost.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the word 通る, so as long as you know that, you should be able to read this one as well. Mind the strange long お sound!",
