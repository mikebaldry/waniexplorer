  "meaningMnemonic": "Things 締める (tighten), and eventually 切る (cut off), meaning you’ve reached the <vocabulary>deadline</vocabulary>! You can associate this with the feeling of your chest tightening once you approach the <vocabulary>due date</vocabulary> for something.\n\nNote that you'll often encounter this written with okurigana like 締め切り as well. You might even see it with a simplified version of the 締 kanji written 〆切, which is relatively common in handwriting!",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this is the stem form of both verbs, so 締め (しめ) and 切り (きり), put together! ",
