  "meaningMnemonic": "An <kanji>eat</kanji> <kanji>thing</kanji> (aka \"a thing you eat\") is <vocabulary>food</vocabulary>. Eat those things. Eat that food. Because it's a \"thing\" you know it's a noun. Interesting how this kanji can turn a verb like this into a noun, right? Look out for it because this pattern will show up with other verbs as well!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too!",
