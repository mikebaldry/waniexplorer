  "meaningMnemonic": "The hiragana ends with an う sound, so you know this is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>return</kanji>, and this verb is transitive, meaning it takes a direct object. You send someone back. You send them home. And tell them to never come near you again. So this means <vocabulary>to send someone back</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to send someone home</vocabulary>.\n\nIn fact, most verbs ending in す are transitive. To help you remember that, think of <reading>su</reading>ing (す) someone to make sure they go home!",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Yay! But since this word has a pair verb, let's think of a way to remember the ending:\n\nWhat's the most surefire way to send someone home? Threaten to <reading>sue</reading> (す) them if they don't!",
