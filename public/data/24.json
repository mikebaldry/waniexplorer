The ノ part is the curvy sword, while the rest is a samurai bowing deeply, like 90 degrees, as he holds that sword — probably before a sword fight. By the way, don't confuse this with the power radical (力). See the difference? In the sword radical (刀), the ノ doesn't pierce through the bowing samurai. (Lucky for him.)",
