The kanji itself means <kanji>defeat</kanji>, so this means <vocabulary>to be defeated</vocabulary>, but also <vocabulary>to be unsuccessful</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have been defeated. You lay there on the ground, and the fans around the stadium are disgusted with your performance. Some hipster walks up to you and says: \"<reading>Yah, Boo</reading>\" (やぶ) referring to how poorly you did. \"No boo!\", you reply back. \"Yah boo\", they say again.",
