As you can probably guess, this last use has a poetic feel to it.\n\nLike many verbs ending in す, this verb is transitive, meaning it's being done to something. So you can use it when you cure an illness, heal a broken heart, or quench your thirst for adventure!",
  "readingMnemonic": "<vocabulary>To heal something</vocabulary> it's sometimes necessary to do something <reading>いや</reading> (gross). Even if you dislike it, even if it's gross, you do it anyway, because you want to heal whatever it is.",
