  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the ちか portion to be able to read this word. Imagine someone <vocabulary>close</vocabulary> to you... Too close. They are so close to you that they're touching their <reading>cheek</reading> (ちか) to your cheek. Feel the cheek on yours, it's getting awkward.",
