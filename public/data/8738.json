  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>sunlight</kanji>, so the verb is <vocabulary>to shine</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to glitter</vocabulary>. Just imagine what happens when sunlight hits things!",
