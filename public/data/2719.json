  "meaningMnemonic": "When you have an <kanji>other</kanji> <kanji>person</kanji>, you really have <vocabulary>another person</vocabulary>.\n\n他人 has a sense of unfamiliarity or distance, and suggests that the person isn’t well-known, or is different from you or a specific group of people. It doesn't usually mean \"another person\" in the sense of an additional person, or another person distinct from the one you’re talking about.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\n<vocabulary>Another person</vocabulary> just stole your <reading>ta</reading>co and your <reading>Nin</reading>tendo (たにん). This complete <vocabulary>stranger</vocabulary> just walked up and took your taco and your Nintendo console straight out of your hands. Yoink.",
