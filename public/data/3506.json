  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is that of the word 出る and the word 会う, both of which you've hopefully seen. The 出 portion may be confusing, but you can usually assume that if one part of the word is kun'yomi / vocab reading, the other part is too, which is why 出 uses the vocab reading.\n\nOh by the way, this word can be written like this too: 出合う. It’s not as common, but you may come across it every now and then, so it’s good to know! ",
