  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a tricky word that doesn't really have a good translation. The best ways I've seen it done in terms of getting a meaning across are <vocabulary>please</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>please help me</vocabulary>. When you say this word you're kind of saying \"please help me out and I'm relying on you and you're kind of awesome too.\" Anyways, <vocabulary>please</vocabulary> is a pretty good way to do it. So, when you see this word you'll notice it has the <kanji>request</kanji> kanji in it. You can guess you're requesting something. What is that thing? It's help (<vocabulary>please help me</vocabulary>) and you're asking very nicely too (<vocabulary>please</vocabulary>).",
  "primaryReading": "おねがいします",
  "readingMnemonic": "You ask for help by saying <vocabulary>please help me</vocabulary>, and that person does try to help you... but the amount they do for you is so <reading>neg</reading>ligible that it hardly does anything to help you at all. Please try to help me again, this time better?",
