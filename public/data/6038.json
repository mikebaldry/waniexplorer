As excitement heaps up in you, you are going <vocabulary>to get excited</vocabulary>. Note how 上がる is in here. This means something is happening to you (or something else), but you're not doing the action. When you get all sorts of excitement building up in you, you aren't really doing it, it's just happening on its own in reaction to something else.",
