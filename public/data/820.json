Clowns are funny and make people laugh, so the leader decided to hire one. Since that time, the leader’s amount of mirth has doubled. \n\nThis also means <kanji>times</kanji>, which makes sense when you think about the kind of math you'll need to double something. What is A * 2? It's A doubled, first of all, but you're using multiplication. You're \"timesing\" something.",
