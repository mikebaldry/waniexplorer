  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this is weird. It's all kun'yomi, which luckily you've seen before, but still strange. I guess when you do <vocabulary>as one pleases</vocabulary> you can read kanji however you want, in this case the kun'yomi readings. Do note that there's a small っ in there before 手, presumably to connect the two readings of the two kanji together.",
