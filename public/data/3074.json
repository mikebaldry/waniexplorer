  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>talk</kanji> so the verb version of this is <vocabulary>to talk</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to speak</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nEvery time you try <vocabulary>to speak</vocabulary>, <reading>花</reading>s (はな) just sprout out of your mouth preventing you. Imagine your mouth full of flowers. Taste them, spit them out, and try to speak again. Same problem.",
