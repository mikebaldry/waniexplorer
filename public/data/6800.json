  "meaningMnemonic": "When たち is attached to a word referring to a person, it makes it plural. So, when you attach たち to 俺 (<kanji>I</kanji>), it means <vocabulary>we</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>us</vocabulary>.\n\nJust remember that 俺 is quite casual and rough sounding, so it's best to only use it with close friends (or when you're shaking someone down...).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.",
