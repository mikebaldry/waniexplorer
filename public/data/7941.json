You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe best way to break out of the <vocabulary>chains</vocabulary> life puts on you is to put on a <reading>cool sari</reading> (くさり). A cool sari will remind you where you come from. Who your family is. And how beautiful you look. Cast off those chains and put on a cool sari!",
