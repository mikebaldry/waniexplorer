  "meaningMnemonic": "Someone who has <kanji>territory</kanji> under their <kanji>sleeve</kanji> is the <vocabulary>leader</vocabulary>. They're the <vocabulary>boss</vocabulary> of all this territory because they say so, and because they shoved it all into their big sleeves.\n\nThis is a very formal word often used in political contexts, particularly when referring to the leader of a faction or political party.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned the on'yomi reading for 袖, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nIt's always hard to fill a <vocabulary>leader</vocabulary>s' <reading>shoe</reading>s (しゅう). Leaders have big responsibilities and power. Just big shoes to fill! Picture these big ol' leader's shoes, like in a literal sense. Not only do they have big responsibilities, leaders have big shoes as well.",
