These are the shoes you wear, though in this case they are specifically <vocabulary>geta</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>Japanese wooden clogs</vocabulary>. The clogs themselves are kind of burdensome and hard to wear too, actually, so you can think of it that way as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 駄 is the secondary kanji reading. Instead of だ it's た. Hopefully you've heard of \"geta\" before. This will make it really easy for you to remember the reading of this vocab word.",
