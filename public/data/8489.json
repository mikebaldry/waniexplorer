  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 縫う means \"to sew.\" Well the only way you can see if a pair of jeans has been sewed with your <kanji>eye</kanji> is if you see a <vocabulary>seam</vocabulary>. If your eyes can't spot the <vocabulary>stitch</vocabulary>es, then it probably wasn't sewed at all. Maybe it was superglued together.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a combination of the words 縫う and 目. Both use the kun'yomi readings so just change the う to い and it's easy! You'll also see this word spelled 縫い目 too. They're exactly the same!",
