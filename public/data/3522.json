When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou see a man walking <vocabulary>east</vocabulary>, toward the sun rising behind that tree, but it's too bright. He trips and <reading>he gash</reading>es (ひがし) his foot on a root that was sticking out of the ground. His foot is torn up really bad, but he tries to take another step and, oh no, he gashes his foot again! This guy is not having an easy time going east.",
