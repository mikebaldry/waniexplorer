You'll see them out there all day long, from dawn till dusk, planting, taking care of, and picking rice.\n\nThis is also a common family name, and on rare occasion, a given name as well. Some well-known people with this name include historical fiction writer Saotome Mitsugu (早乙女 貢), former pro-wrestler, model, and idol Saotome Miku (早乙女 未来), and stage and screen actor Saotome Taichi (早乙女 太一).",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a really weird exception, sorry. You've kind of learned these reading, but they're like... weird variations of them.\n\nTake the さ from 早速, the おつ becomes おと, and then the 女 kun'yomi め (hey that one's normal!). And you get さおとめ. You might need to just memorize this one.",
