  "readingMnemonic": "While you’re in the <kanji>interior</kanji> of this guy, you hear him break out in song. He starts singing “<reading>Ok</reading>lahoma” (おく) at the top of his lungs. The big pieces of rice slosh around as he sings and dances. “OOOOk-lahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain!”",

And by interior, I mean you’re actually inside someone. The rice is big because you’ve shrunk to a tiny size and are inside someone’s stomach. The drop on your head is actually digestive fluid.",
