For example, you can use 大事 to describe something or someone that matters a lot to you. You can also use 大事 to describe a crucial task or moment. And if you want to bring up a serious topic, you may say that you have something 大事 to talk about.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nNothing in your life is as <vocabulary>important</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>valuable</vocabulary> to you as <reading>dye</reading>s (だい). You really just love dyes more than anything else. Dyes, dyes, dyes!",
