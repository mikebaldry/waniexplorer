  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>surpass</kanji>, but this verb is intransitive, meaning we’re not focussing on who did the action, but on the action itself. So this means <vocabulary>to pass</vocabulary>, as in “the storm passed”, <vocabulary>to be over</vocabulary> as in “winter’s over”, or <vocabulary>to be too much</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIn order for the storm <vocabulary>to pass</vocabulary> you’re going to have to <reading>sue</reading> (す) it. Sadly storms won’t pass unless you take legal action these days.",
