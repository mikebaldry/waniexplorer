Look up \"koseki\" in Google and you're sure to find many fascinating histories.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 戸 is an exception. Instead of と it's こ. Just think about how the person who runs this census doesn't care about number of toes. They care about number of <reading>子</reading> (こ).",
