  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. This word is actually two words put together, though. 亡く means \"be deceased.\" なる means \"to become.\" So put that all together and you have <vocabulary>to pass away</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to become deceased</vocabulary>. It's basically a polite way to say something died (死ぬ).",
  "readingMnemonic": "To learn to read this kanji you have to remember the な part of 亡く, though our mnemonic will use the whole thing.\n\nIf you're about to become deceased, you are probably <reading>knock</reading>ing (なく) on death's door.",
