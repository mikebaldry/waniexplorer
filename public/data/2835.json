  "meaningMnemonic": "When the kanji for <kanji>angle</kanji> is used as a standalone word, it usually means <vocabulary>corner</vocabulary>. You can remember this because corners are pretty much the most common kind of angle you see in everyday life.\n\nIn math contexts, it can also mean <kanji>angle</kanji> — just like the kanji's meaning!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word has two different meanings and each one has its own reading.\n\nWhen it's used for <vocabulary>corner</vocabulary>s, the reading is かど. Just picture a deck of <reading>card</reading>s (かど). What's the most important part of the card? The corner! The corners are where the numbers are. Now tape those cards into all the corners of your house. Why? Because it's artsy!\n\nAnd the second meaning and reading pair is easy — <vocabulary>angle</vocabulary> and かく, which you already know from the kanji!",
