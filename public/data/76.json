Also, did you notice that this is just the top part of the head (冂) radical? This is just the forehead part of that!\n\nDon't confuse this for a roof! You know this is a forehead and not a roof because this doesn't have a cute little chimney sticking out of the top. Foreheads definitely don't have chimneys.",
