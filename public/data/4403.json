  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nてき and かたき, however, have slightly different nuances. てき simply means “enemy”, whereas かたき typically refers to someone you hold a deep grudge against, often on behalf of another. ",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. No enemies here!",
