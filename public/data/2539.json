  "meaningMnemonic": "Think of someone holding out their hand. This is average. Things rated below the hand are things you're bad at. Things rated <kanji>above</kanji> the <kanji>hand</kanji> are things you're <vocabulary>good at</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Both of these kanji use on'yomi readings, though 手 uses an on'yomi reading you didn't learn with the kanji. It's a rare reading, so it wasn't included (and we just have to deal with exceptions like this as we go along). To remember the reading for this word, here's a mnemonic:\n\nWhat are you good at? You're really <vocabulary>good at</vocabulary> taking <reading>Joe</reading> (じょう) to the <reading>zoo</reading> (ず). No one else can take Joe to the zoo—he gets mad and throws them into the animal enclosures. But you? Joe trusts you.",
