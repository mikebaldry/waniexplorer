  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>rub</kanji> and this verb means <vocabulary>to rub</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to scrub</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "If you're going <vocabulary>to rub</vocabulary> me like that, I'm going to <reading>sue</reading> (す) you. It's making me very uncomfortable. The <reading>cos</reading>t  (こす) of your rubbing actions will be high.\n    \nSo this word has two readings and both mean “to rub.” But you usually use する for a single action, such as lighting a match or grazing your knee, while こする means doing it repeatedly, like when you’re cleaning or polishing something.",
