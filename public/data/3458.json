  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 入り口 means entrance and 出口 means exit? This is just the 口 part with a direction on it. That means it can be both entrance or exit. So when you have <kanji>East</kanji> up there this word can mean both <vocabulary>East exit</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>East entrance</vocabulary>. This is a great word to know if you need to know which side of a train station you need to leave on to go somewhere or meet someone!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses kun'yomi readings, possibly because of 口, which is a body part (body parts do that quite a bit in words and kanji). You should hopefully have seen both the kun'yomi readings from previous levels meaning you can read this word as well. Just watch out for the rendaku that changes くち to ぐち.",
