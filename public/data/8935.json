  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Extended",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThis is an intransitive verb, meaning that it happens on its own, and we're not talking about what makes it happen. So this verb means <vocabulary>to be extended</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be delayed</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to be prolonged</vocabulary>. If you know the word ビル, you can think about how building work is always prolonged or delayed, to help you remember that this is intransitive. We never know why it's delayed, it just happens all by itself!",
  "primaryReading": "のびる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\n\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 延ばす.",
