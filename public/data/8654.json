You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe most <vocabulary>ugly</vocabulary> thing you've ever seen was a <reading>mini coo</reading>kie (みにく). Why would any one want a tiny cookie? Cookies should be huge, and enough to fill you up. The more you look at the mini cookie it seems to become uglier and uglier to you.",
