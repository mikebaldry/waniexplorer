  "meaningMnemonic": "With an い on the end, you can guess that this word is an い-adjective. What is the adjective version of the kanji <kanji>丸</kanji>? \"Circle\" becomes <vocabulary>circular</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>spherical</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>round</vocabulary>. This, compared to another similar word (円), is more general purpose and can be used with 3D spherical objects as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses the reading you learned for the kanji <kanji>丸</kanji>, though you'll need to tack the い onto the end too.",
