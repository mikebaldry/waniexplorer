I didn’t ask for this!” “Eh!?!?” you reply. Apparently he didn’t want a real heart, he wanted a candy one. He wanted a Valentine!",

The heart needs to be purified so that’s why you have it on the cross and your friend lives on a rice paddy farm so that’s why you’re running through that. The favor you are paying your friend back with is getting him this heart. He needs a new one and you’re providing it.",
