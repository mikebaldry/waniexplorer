  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>stop</kanji> and the verb vocab version of that is <vocabulary>to stop something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis particular word is when you're stopping something (i.e. doing the action of stopping it).",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to stop something</vocabulary> from moving. Maybe a car... or a door... or a person... whatever you want. To stop this thing, you throw out your <reading>toe</reading> (と), getting it smashed in the process. Imagine it bleeding and swelling up. How much it hurts! You put your toe out to stop this big thing, what a mistake!",
