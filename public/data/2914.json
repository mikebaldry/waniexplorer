  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned that reading with this kanji, but here's a reminder of the mnemonic just in case: \n\nYou have to remember the おも part to read this word. To do this, though, you'll have <vocabulary>to think</vocabulary> about that guy... hmm... what was his name? He's on The Simpsons... he's the bartender? I think? <reading>Oh! Moe</reading> (おも) is his name! Thank you. Now I remember.\n\nIf you don't know Moe from the Simpsons use a different Moe, perhaps the one from the Three Stooges? You should be able to come up with one.",
