  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <jう sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>below</kanji>, and 下がる means <vocabulary>to get lower</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to go down</vocabulary>.\n\nIt's an intransitive verb, so it doesn't take a direct object. For example: Prices fall. Temperatures come down. See? No direct object. You can remember this because your fever only goes down when a <reading>girl</reading> (<ja>がる</ja>) takes care of you. It has to be a girl if you want your fever to come down!",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to remember the reading of the kanji:\n\nYou know it means <vocabulary>to fall</vocabulary> so instead of using a <reading>sa</reading>w (さ) to cut down the tree, you decide to let it come to you. It has to come down all by itself. Picture yourself placing a saw at the foot of a tree then sitting back and waiting for it to drop itself at your knees. (This could actually work, don't you judge my methods!)",
