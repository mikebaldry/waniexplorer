That means everyone calls him Sheep-sama. No one calls him just \"Sheep,\" since he's kind of a big deal. He's actually like sheep royalty. When he's not in his castle, Sheep-sama enjoys playing in the water by the trees.\n\nThis can also mean <kanji>manner</kanji>, as in your manner of doing things. I guess someone with a formal name ender has a different manner of doing things.",
