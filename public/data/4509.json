  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the kanji, though it's kind of like an add-on for other words in a sense, which makes it behave like jukugo, I think. Don't confuse this with 各々 though. That one does use the kun'yomi reading, which is strange when you consider this one doesn't. Every kanji has its own \"perks\" I suppose.",
