  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>scatter</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be scattered</vocabulary>. You know that this verb represents when something is scattering (you're not doing the scattering), because you would never be so <reading>ru</reading>de as to scatter someone or something yourself. It only happens when it happens on its own.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Think about something scattering. That something is <reading>chee</reading>se (ち), scattering all over the floor, going everywhere, getting in everything. Ugh, you hate how cheese scatters, don't you?",
