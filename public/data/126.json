Specifically a boy cow, since you can think of that top horizontal line as its horns. Seeing it yet? It's got a little tuft of hair on its head, and some kind of accessory on the horn to your left, so this is a very stylish cow.\n\n(And yes, you may say a \"boy cow\" isn't a \"cow,\" but we're still calling this a cow. Please don't write in about it — we don't want any beef.)",
