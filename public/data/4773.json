  "primaryMeaning": "To Include",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>include</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to include</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to contain</vocabulary>.\n\nWhile 含む can be used in everyday conversation, it’s a relatively formal word that is generally used in explanatory sentences.",
  "primaryReading": "ふくむ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThey don't want <vocabulary>to include</vocabulary> you in their game? Well, \"<reading>F***</reading> (ふく) you!\" you yell at them, because they wouldn't include you.",
