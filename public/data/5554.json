  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The ざつ goes to ざっ and the ひ goes to ぴ, making it into a dumb sounding word, like \"zappy\" (ざっぴ), so you can think about how some of your miscellaneous expenses were on zappy items.",
