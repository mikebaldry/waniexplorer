  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>run</kanji> so now you know the verb version of that is <vocabulary>to run</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the はし portion. Think of yourself running. It's nice. As you run, though, you notice the ground changing into something weird and mushy. Everything is turning into <reading>hash</reading> (はし) browns. You start to get sucked in, and soon you can't run anymore. Smell the hash browns and taste them too. What a terrible run this was.",
