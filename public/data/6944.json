  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is a little different from 群れる, though. There's an extra ら in there. That being said, it's pretty similar, so you should be able to use one to remember the other after a few reps. You can also think about it this way: Everyone is flocking together in one place. Strange thing is, it's to a small <reading>村</reading> (むら). There's a 村 reunion going on, that's why.",
