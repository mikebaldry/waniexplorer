  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means both <kanji>music</kanji> and <kanji>bend</kanji>. For this word, we're looking at \"bend.\" So the verb <ja>曲がる</ja> is <vocabulary>to be bent</vocabulary>. \n\nIt's intransitive, so don't give it a direct object. Use it to say something gets bent or bends: a knee is bent, the road bends — that sort of thing. \n\nVerbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive like this. You can remember this because if something is <ja>ある</ja>, it's just there, existing, not acting <em>on</em> anything else. That's why verbs that sound like it are often intransitive too!",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading with 曲げる, so you should be good to go!",
