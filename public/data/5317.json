  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>photograph</kanji>. When you make that into a verb, it becomes <vocabulary>to take a picture</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to take a video</vocabulary>. Basically, it's for any form of shooting you do with a camera!",
  "readingMnemonic": "<vocabulary>To take a picture</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to take a video</vocabulary>… You \"take\" all these things. And how do you say \"to take\" in Japanese? It's <reading>取る</reading> (とる), which happens to share a reading with this word. Different kanji but related meanings, and exactly the same reading!",
