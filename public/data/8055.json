Or <vocabulary>humbly eating</vocabulary> it if they gave you food and not a puppy or something inedible. It can also mean <vocabulary>humbly having</vocabulary>. The theme here is humility!\n\nThis is usually formal when written in kanji and used together with a verb like する. It can also be used alone to make very casual requests.
