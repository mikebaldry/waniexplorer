  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>four</kanji> <kanji>season</kanji>s are <vocabulary>the four seasons</vocabulary>. For some reason many Japanese people think that Japan's the only place with four distinct seasons. Obviously they haven't been to half the places on their latitude around the world.",
  "primaryReading": "しき",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that 四 is read using the on'yomi reading, which you've seen a few times over the course of WaniKani. Think of し meaning \"death\" (like 死), and how with the four seasons there comes death every Fall and Winter.",
