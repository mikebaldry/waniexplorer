  "primaryReading": "けむい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You sort of did learn this reading with the vocabulary word 煙, but this one is just different enough where we thought we should make a mnemonic for this one: \n\nAll this <vocabulary>smoki</vocabulary>ness is from a terrible <reading>chem</reading>ical (けむ) spill that happened nearby. It was acid, so it burned everything up real good, causing the air to get pretty smoky.",
