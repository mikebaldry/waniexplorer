  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Grief</kanji> shows in your <kanji>eye</kanji>s by making them look like you've gone through a lot of <vocabulary>bitterness</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>hardship</vocabulary>. You can always see it in someone else if you look them in the eyes too.\n\nYou’ll see this word most often in 憂き目を見る and 憂き目に合う, which both mean “to experience <vocabulary>misery</vocabulary>.”",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses one of the kun'yomi readings for the kanji. You haven’t learned this kun’yomi reading for 憂, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nWhy the <vocabulary>bitterness</vocabulary> in your eyes? You visited a famed <reading>u</reading>ni (う) restaurant, only to find it closed and locked. Where is the <reading>key</reading> (き)? Your <reading>目</reading>s scream of the uni missed. In a sea of <vocabulary>misery</vocabulary>, a missed uni is the hardest to swallow.",
