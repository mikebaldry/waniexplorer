  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Letter</kanji> <kanji>rule</kanji>s can be found in a <vocabulary>character dictionary</vocabulary>. In Japanese, one kanji \"letter\" or \"character\" can hold a lot of information, so you have dictionaries dedicated to kanji meanings. That's what this is.\n\nThis word is a little old-fashioned these days, so you might also see 漢字辞典 used for a character dictionary. (You'll learn 辞典 soon, if you haven't already!)",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
