Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>draw near</kanji>, so this verb version is <vocabulary>to draw near</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to stop by</vocabulary>, since stopping by a place is like drawing near it briefly, right?",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you're too shy to <vocabulary>draw near</vocabulary> to people, just learn how to use a <reading>yo</reading>-yo (よ)! Then people will draw near to YOU to compliment you on your sick skills. You won't have to do it yourself!",
