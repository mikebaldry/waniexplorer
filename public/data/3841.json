  "meaningMnemonic": "Things that <kanji>hurry</kanji> and <kanji>go</kanji> faster than the other things are <vocabulary>express</vocabulary>. This is often used with trains or subways, so look out for it if you're looking to get somewhere in a hurry. Also be careful in case it doesn't stop at your stop, because 急行 trains don't stop at every station (which is what makes them express!).",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
