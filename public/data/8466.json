You’ll usually encounter this in the form of ~した拍子に. Have a look at our context sentences to see this usage in action!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of its kanji. However, 拍 uses its secondary reading, which you haven’t learned yet, so here’s a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou get the <vocabulary>beat</vocabulary> and the <vocabulary>rhythm</vocabulary> going in your body. You can't help but sing out loud, \"<reading>Heyo</reading> (ひょう), heyo!\" Feel that rhythm and sing with me! HEYO HEYO!",
