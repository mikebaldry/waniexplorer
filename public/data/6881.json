It only contains the parts that walk around and move, not so much the descriptions (things that don't move). This kind of book is a <vocabulary>script</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>screenplay</vocabulary>. These \"books\" are focused on actions and things people say, which is why it's just the legs.",
