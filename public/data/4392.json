The kanji itself means <kanji>decrease</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to decrease something</vocabulary>. You can differentiate this from 減る because with this one, you are the one that is going to be doing the decreasing. The <reading>rush</reading> (らす) of decreasing something fills your veins.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 減る, so if you know that reading you should know this one.",
