When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nThink about a song... but not just any song... think about the <reading>utter</reading> (うた) song, and make it up right now and sing it out loud. What does the utter song sound like? Why do you love utterances so much that you made a song about them?",
