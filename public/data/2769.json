  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>skin</kanji> on the <kanji>meat</kanji> is kind of like the outer shell. It's not very nice, and people who eat only meat skin tend to use <vocabulary>sarcasm</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>irony</vocabulary>. That being said, Japanese people don't really understand sarcasm. So, maybe that's why \"meat skin\" means \"sarcasm.\" Is this ironic? Now I'm not even sure.",
