  "meaningMnemonic": "振る is \"to shake.\" 仮名 is kana. This word refers to <vocabulary>furigana</vocabulary>, which is the little kana that's put next to kanji for the people who don't use WaniKani and can't read anything. As to why it's called \"shake kana\"? I have no clue. Just imagine putting little kana next to kanji and watching them shake around, though, and you should be good to go.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are 振る and 仮名 put together into one. If you know those words, you won't need no furigana to help you with this word.",
