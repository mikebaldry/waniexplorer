  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Wood</kanji> that is <kanji>lumber</kanji> is <vocabulary>lumber</vocabulary> <vocabulary>wood</vocabulary>.\n\nTechnically speaking, 木材 is used more for lumber or wood that hasn't been processed yet — less like planks, more like freshly cut lumber still lying on the forest floor. But it's not a hard rule or anything, so don't worry too much about the nuances.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
