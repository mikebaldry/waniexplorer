  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>meat</kanji> <kanji>shop</kanji> is a place that sells meat. Who sells meat? A <vocabulary>butcher shop</vocabulary>!\n\n肉屋 often refers to the butcher shop, but it can also mean the actual butchers who work there. You might also see this as お肉屋さん, but that won't change the meaning — it can still be either the shop or the butcher, depending on context!",
  "readingMnemonic": "For 肉 you use the にく reading (which you learned with the kanji). For 屋 you use the kun'yomi, which you learned with the kanji. Basically, if you learned the kanji readings, you can read this word!",
