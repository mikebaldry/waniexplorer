  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this is strange. It's the kun'yomi vocab reading, probably because the literal translation is \"mother parent\" and therefore consists of a couple words combined together into one concept. So, make sure you know the separate word readings of 母 and 親. If you do, you should be able to read this too.",
