You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nA <vocabulary>star</vocabulary> is just a <reading>who</reading>le <reading>shee</reading>p (ほし) floating in the sky. If it wasn't a whole sheep, it wouldn't shine so brightly and you wouldn't be able to see it from Earth. Don't let anyone tell you stars are made of gas. The whole thing is sheep, okay?",
