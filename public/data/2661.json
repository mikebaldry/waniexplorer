  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. However, 大 uses the kun'yomi reading and 文 is an exception here, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this:\n\nWhenever you see an <vocabulary>uppercase letter</vocabulary>, you shout \"<reading>おお</reading>, <reading>Moe</reading>!\" (おおも). Your buddy Moe taught you the letters in the first place, so when you get stuck, you yell for him to come help you. And he always does. What a good guy.",
