  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>send</kanji>, and the the vocab verb version is <vocabulary>to send something</vocabulary>. If the object of this verb is a person, it means \"to send\" in the sense of <vocabulary>to escort someone</vocabulary>, maybe to the station, or to the door.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need to send an entire <reading>oak</reading> (おく) tree in the mail, but it's too big. Imagine yourself dragging one to the post office. They tell you that you can't send that here... Go to the oak sending facilities.",
