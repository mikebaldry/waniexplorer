  "readingMnemonic": "This kanji has more than one important reading you need to learn! But don't worry, here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou always put <kanji>writing</kanji> on your <reading>bun</reading>s (ぶん) to keep them from getting eaten by the bun <reading>mon</reading>ster (もん). What kind of writing? Usually it's just an X to show the monster these buns are off-limits. (In fact, it kind of looks like the X part in 文. Hmm…)",
