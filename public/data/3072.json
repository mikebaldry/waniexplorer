You haven't learned this reading for 楽 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you play your <vocabulary>music</vocabulary> too loud, people will come and <reading>gawk</reading> (がく) at you. But if you try to turn it off and say, \"OH I DON'T LIKE MUSIC ANYWAY!\" they'll gawk at you even more. Learn proper music etiquette and people won't gawk at you so much, okay?",
