  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>neglect</kanji> and <kanji>lazy</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to neglect</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be idle</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou decide <vocabulary>to neglect</vocabulary> everything. Your school, your family, even your own <reading>name</reading> (なま). You've managed <vocabulary>to slack</vocabulary> for so long that you can't even remember your name? That's pretty impressive, actually.",
