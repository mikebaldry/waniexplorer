No, no, get your shins flat on the ground to show how humble you really are. Luckily, you're wearing <reading>jean</reading>s (じん), so at least that will stop your poor shins getting chafed!",

You never really feel humble in front of anyone else, but if you meet a god's spirit… Well, you should probably lower yourself appropriately. Gods have powerful spirits.",
