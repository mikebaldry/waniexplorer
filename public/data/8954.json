  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends in an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji <ja>温</ja> means <kanji>warm</kanji>. So the verb <ja>温まる</ja> means <vocabulary>to warm up</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to get warm</vocabulary>. \n\n温まる is intransitive, so no direct object needed. Your cat warms up in the sunlight, for example. No direct object, right? A hint for this is that <ja>温まる</ja> ends with okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja>, and those kinds of verbs tend to be intransitive!",
  "readingMnemonic": "The kanji reading is the same as 温かい and 温める. ",
