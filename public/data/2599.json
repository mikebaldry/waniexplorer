  "primaryMeaning": "To Divide Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う (in this case る) sound, you know this word is a verb. One of the kanji meanings is <kanji>divide</kanji>, which makes this <vocabulary>to divide something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to separate something</vocabulary>. Depending on the context, it can also mean <vocabulary>to share</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to classify</vocabulary>.\n\nBe careful not to confuse this with 分かる, a similar word with a different meaning. Think of it this way: You \"separate\" what you care (ける) about from everything else. You want to separate those special things you care about from all the other things you don't care about.",
  "primaryReading": "わける",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already know this reading from 分かる, but here’s a mnemonic in case you forgot:\n\nWhenever you need <vocabulary>to divide something</vocabulary>, you can’t help screaming \"<reading>WAAAAAAAAAHHHH</reading>\" (わ). You hate having to divide things, or people, so you always end up screaming \"WAAAAAAAAAHHHH\" in agony.",
