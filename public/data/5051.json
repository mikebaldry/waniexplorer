  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning it's probably an adjective. The kanji means <kanji>dense</kanji>, and this can also mean <vocabulary>dense</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>thick</vocabulary> in some contexts, like if you’re describing fog, or body hair! More generally, it can be used for anything that’s highly concentrated, so you can use it for things like <vocabulary>deep</vocabulary> colors, or <vocabulary>strong</vocabulary> coffee too!",
  "readingMnemonic": "What’s the most <vocabulary>dense</vocabulary> thing you can think of? A <reading>子</reading> (こ). Children are so full of joy, you can practically see how dense, <vocabulary>thick</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>concentrated</vocabulary> the joy is.",
