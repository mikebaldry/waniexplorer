  "meaningMnemonic": "You have <kanji>righteousness</kanji> and then a <kanji>reason</kanji> behind it, at least in your own mind. This is your <vocabulary>sense of duty</vocabulary>. And it really is a \"sense\" in a way, too. You just feel it. It's not an actual thing that is tangible. It is your own personal reason for this righteousness.\n\nThis word can also mean <vocabulary>in-law</vocabulary> like your mother-in-law, because they're your mother in the social obligation sense only, not by blood.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
