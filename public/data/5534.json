  "meaningMnemonic": "An <kanji>eternity</kanji> that is <kanji>far</kanji> away is not really an eternity, it just feels like it. It's <vocabulary>forever</vocabulary>, but not the real kind of forever that's actually forever. That's 永久, which is a real forever, this is more like \"whoa, I haven't eaten sushi in forever\" (actually, you have).",
