  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You learned the readings for both of these, but 役 uses a less common reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this:\n\nYou're <vocabulary>actively working</vocabulary> at the <reading>駅</reading> (えき) and you plan to remain <vocabulary>active</vocabulary> there forever! You sure do love that 駅, it's like you're inseparable.",
