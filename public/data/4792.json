  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>supplement</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to supplement</vocabulary>.\n\nNote that this word is generally considered relatively formal in tone.",
  "readingMnemonic": "<reading>Oh, gee, now</reading> (おぎな) you're going <vocabulary>to supplement</vocabulary> it? That would have been helpful earlier. Might help to say \"oh gee now\" with a ぎ sound instead of \"ji\" sound out loud, too. This is a tricky reading, won't be learned too easily, so think about it a bit now.",
