  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>mix</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to get mixed</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be mixed</vocabulary>. This is when something is just getting mixed and you're not directly doing the action of mixing anything. You can remember this because the <reading>Tzar</reading> (ざる) of Russia is very impressed that things mix on their own and you're not doing the mixing.\n\nThe connotation for this word is you can't distinguish the things you're mixing, like combining paints, which become one mixed color that isn't two separate colors anymore.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you're not doing the mixing, in order for things <vocabulary>to get mixed</vocabulary> you call your <reading>ma</reading> (ま) up and ask her to mix it. What a terrible lazy child you are.",
