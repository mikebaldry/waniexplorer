The verb version is <vocabulary>to yell</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to shout</vocabulary>.\n\n怒鳴る suggests anger, as you can tell from the kanji, so it's used when someone yells or shouts to scold others or to express anger or frustration.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This one is a bit tricky, as it uses the on'yomi reading you learned for 怒 and the kun'yomi reading for 鳴る, so try to keep that in mind!",
