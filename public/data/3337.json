  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>extinguish</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to extinguish something</vocabulary>. You can also use this word to say <vocabulary>to erase something</vocabulary>, like data, and <vocabulary>to turn something off</vocabulary>, like the lights or the power. Technically you're extinguishing the data, as well as the lights or power, right?",

The <reading>ke</reading>ttle (け) got too hot, and it caught on fire.",
