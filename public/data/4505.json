  "meaningMnemonic": "Here's a weird one for you. You have a <kanji>red</kanji> <kanji>monk</kanji>. What is this? It's a <vocabulary>baby</vocabulary>. Think about it. Babies, when they come out, are all red. Also, they have a shaved head, just like a monk would. So, a \"red monk\" is really just a baby. I wonder who's getting the shorter end of the stick here, the monk or the baby? Probably the monk.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the kun'yomi vocab reading of 赤 (you learned this with the kanji) and the reading you learned for 坊 as well.",
