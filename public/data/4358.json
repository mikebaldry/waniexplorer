  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Pretend you're trying to <kanji>whistle</kanji>, but you can't. All that comes out is air. You make a \"<reading>Fuuuuuuueh</reading>\" sound over and over, because you can't get the whole whistling thing down. Go ahead and pretend to do that (or do it for real).",
