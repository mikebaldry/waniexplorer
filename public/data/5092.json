  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to retreat</vocabulary> because <reading>she re-zo</reading>ned (しりぞ) where you are standing. Now this is a no standing zone. Who is she? The re-zoner, duh. ",
