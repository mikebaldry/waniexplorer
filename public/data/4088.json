  "meaningMnemonic": "If you <kanji>consume</kanji> <kanji>tea</kanji> in a <kanji>shop</kanji>, it could either be a <vocabulary>cafe</vocabulary>, a <vocabulary>tea house</vocabulary>, or slightly confusingly, a <vocabulary>coffee shop</vocabulary>. Welcome! Sit down. Relax. Have some tea (or coffee).\n\nThis word often refers to cafes with a retro feel to them, though they can be modern too. These places usually serve a variety of drinks and light meals.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are what you'd expect except for きつ getting shortened to きっ and 茶, which has this strange さ reading. To remember that it's さ instead of ちゃ, think of this <vocabulary>tea house</vocabulary> you're going in. You think it's nice and pleasant, and it is for a while... until someone starts working a <reading>saw</reading> (さ) outside, ruining the atmosphere. BEWWEEEEHHHEEEHHHHHE gatatatatatat BWEEEHEEE.",
