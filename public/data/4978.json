I guess brewing <em>is</em> like constructing, since it involves carefully choosing and mixing ingredients to get those sip-worthy creations!",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is like 作る, which means \"to make.\" They have very similar meanings, but different kanji. Use 作る to help you to remember the reading of this word.",
