  "meaningMnemonic": "The prime minister's (総理) <kanji>government</kanji> is where he does all his governmenting. It's where the Japanese <vocabulary>Prime Minister's Office</vocabulary> (aka the <vocabulary>Cabinet Office</vocabulary>) is located as well.\n\n総理府 was actually renamed 内閣府 in 2001, so you'd generally only use 総理府 to talk about the Cabinet Offices from back in the day.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know 総理 beforehand as well.",
