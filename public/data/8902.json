  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>amazing</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>amazing</vocabulary>! Or <vocabulary>terrible</vocabulary>. This word can be both good and bad, it really depends on the context, because what is amazing is usually also a little awful. You know? ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe most <vocabulary>amazing</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>terrible</vocabulary> thing you've ever seen is <reading>Su</reading>it <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (すご). Godzilla was wearing a nice suit (amazing!) but also destroying your home, your friends, and your family (terrible!).",
