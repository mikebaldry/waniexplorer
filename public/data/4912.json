  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nI am going <vocabulary>to obey</vocabulary> you. I think your order is a bit of <reading>shit が</reading> (したが), I'll do it and obey you. \n\n(Little side note, did you know が in the middle of a sentence can mean \"but\" in Japanese? Think of it as that meaning here.)",
