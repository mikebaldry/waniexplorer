  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 間違い means \"a mistake?\" Well this is the verb version. It means <vocabulary>to make a mistake</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to mistake</vocabulary>.\n\nThis verb is transitive. That means that it takes a direct object. Bear in mind that this one is a bit tricky, though, because although it's transitive in Japanese, the English translation will sometimes be intransitive.",
  "readingMnemonic": "It's read the same as 間違い! Nice and easy!",
