  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>look for</kanji> and the verb version of the kanji is <vocabulary>to look for</vocabulary>.\n\n\nCurious about the difference between 捜す and 探す? While there is some overlap between the two, 捜す is typically used in official, thorough searches for something or someone that is thought to concretely exist and has disappeared or cannot be easily found. In contrast, 探す can also be used for personal searches for things that one desires or is looking for.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You are looking for a <reading>sagger</reading> (さが) amongst the products you're shipping off overseas. The saggers are the boxes that have weird lumps sagging out of them, which means they broke and are getting things wet. So, find the saggers. Go <vocabulary>to search for</vocabulary> them, because they could ruin the whole shipment.",
