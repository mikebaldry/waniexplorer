You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you always seem <vocabulary>to be negligent</vocabulary> to your kids you'll end up with this situation. It's winter and your kid comes home from school covered in snow and sneezing. \"<reading>Oh, coat</reading>... (おこた)\" you say. You didn't give them a coat when they went out today. Maybe if you weren't so negligent that wouldn't have happened.",
