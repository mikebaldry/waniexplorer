  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that 向 means <kanji>yonder</kanji>. So, think of a \"yonder こういち.\" All you know is that he's <vocabulary>over there</vocabulary> on the <vocabulary>other side</vocabulary> / <vocabulary>opposite side</vocabulary> of where you are. Basically, he's just pretty <vocabulary>far away</vocabulary>, wherever he is.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nStanding with こういち is a cow. It is saying <reading>moo</reading> (む). Weird, now こういち is saying it too. Also, if you know the reading of 向く you should be able to read this one as well.",
