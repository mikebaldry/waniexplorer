  "meaningMnemonic": "You've seen the word 化ける (to transform) before. Now we have a similar word. This word means <vocabulary>to bewitch</vocabulary> because when you cuss (かす) you are saying a magic word and bewitching the person in front of you. Imagine yourself yelling out cuss words, and every time a new enchantment falls upon your victim.\n\nThis verb is transitive, meaning it takes a direct object. You bewitch someone or something.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 化ける, so make sure you know that word and you'll be able to learn this word's reading as well.",
