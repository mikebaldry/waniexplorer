  "meaningMnemonic": "When something is <kanji>close</kanji> <kanji>close</kanji> (the 々 character repeats the kanji that was before it) it will happen <vocabulary>in the near future</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>soon</vocabulary>. \n\nThis is pretty vague, and it's up to the person speaking to decide how soon <vocabulary>soon</vocabulary> is. Depending on the person and the situation, it could technically be used for anything up to a few years!",
  "primaryReading": "ちかぢか",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the kun'yomi reading twice; that's the one you learn with the vocab word 近い from the previous level. The second 近 gets converted to ぢか, though, so take note of that. To write the character ぢ, type \"di\" on your keyboard.",
