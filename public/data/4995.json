  "meaningMnemonic": "It can <kanji>hinder</kanji> a <kanji>child</kanji>, but that's about it. This is a <vocabulary>shoji screen</vocabulary>, which is a type of <vocabulary>Japanese sliding door</vocabulary>. They're typically covered with thin paper, so, you know, an adult can go through it but a child would be hindered by it.\n\nShoji are made of thin paper stretched across a wooden lattice frame. They're lightweight and designed to let in some natural light.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The 子 is changed from し to じ, though, so be careful.",
