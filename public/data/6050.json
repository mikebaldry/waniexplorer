  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>hop</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to hop</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to jump</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to leap</vocabulary>. Basically anything that gets both feet off the ground via your own foot propulsion.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Know how 飛ぶ means \"to fly\"? This is a similar idea, though this time you're not flying nearly as much, because you're just hopping or jumping. Anyways, the readings are the same.",
