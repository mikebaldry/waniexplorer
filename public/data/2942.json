  "meaningMnemonic": "When you do something that's your <kanji>fault</kanji> and then you say \"<kanji>thanks</kanji>\" after you do it, that's super-duper <vocabulary>rude</vocabulary>, wouldn't you say? Imagine doing something like this and then thinking to yourself after... wow, I was really rude.\n\nThis is also often used to mean <vocabulary>excuse me</vocabulary>, typically followed by ですが or します. Occasionally, it’s also used just on its own, usually when the speaker holds a higher or equal status to the person being spoken to. This particular usage is more prevalent among older generations and is commonly associated with masculine speech.\n",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
