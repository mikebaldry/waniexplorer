  "meaningMnemonic": "This shares one of the meanings you learned for the kanji: <vocabulary>after</vocabulary>. You can differentiate this one from 後ろ (which you may or may not have seen yet) thanks to the で on the end. Some people believe that after something's dead (で), it goes to an afterlife.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\n<vocabulary>After</vocabulary>. Everything happens after. It's a cause and effect chain. One thing happens, and then another thing happens after. This is life. This is the universe. Everything is after. It's an <reading>auto</reading>matic (あと) cycle that just keeps going and going and going.",
