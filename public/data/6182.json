The kanji itself means <kanji>lean</kanji>, and the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to be leaned</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be tilted</vocabulary>. You aren't doing the leaning or the tilting, though, you're just watching, which is why you say \"cool\" (く) when you see it, because it's already done.",
