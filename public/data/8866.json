  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 諦, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIn <vocabulary>resignation</vocabulary>, you throw all of your <reading>ta</reading>ter (てい) tots onto the ground. Look at the tater tots at your feet. Now they're lying scattered there, a symbol of your feelings of resignation.",
