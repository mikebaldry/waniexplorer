  "meaningMnemonic": "If you <kanji>stab</kanji> to <kanji>pierce</kanji> something, you’d better do it in a <vocabulary>rush</vocabulary>. If you aren't quick enough, you could get into trouble, so rush forth with a mighty charge.\n\n突貫 means doing something in a rush. It’s usually used in the compound 突貫工事, which means fast but often sloppy construction work. It can also describe charging at an enemy, but that meaning is less common today.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.",
