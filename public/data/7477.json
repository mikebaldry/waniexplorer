  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember 足りる? That is \"to be enough.\" How can you make something be enough? You keep adding things to the pile until you reach that point where there are enough! That's why this verb is <vocabulary>to add something</vocabulary>, because you keep adding things until you 足りる.\n\nThis verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in す, which is why you are adding something. It's not getting itself added all by itself. Maybe you add so much that someone tries to <reading>sue</reading> (す) you for that nasty pile of squirrels you keep outside.",
  "primaryReading": "たす",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 足りる, so if you know that you can add things up to this.",
