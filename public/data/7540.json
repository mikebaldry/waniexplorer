In other words, you show someone who doubted you or treated you unfairly what you’re really capable of.\n\nThere are a couple of other meanings, too. It can mean <vocabulary>to look back over something</vocabulary>, like the answers to your kanji test you want to double check, and sometimes <vocabulary>to return someone’s stare</vocabulary>. You can see how all of these meanings relate to the kanji, right?",
