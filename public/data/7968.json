  "meaningMnemonic": "You've learned that 召す can mean \"to take\" when a social higher-up takes a meal or a drink. Now you're adding 上がる (to go up), so you've got the added image of the food or drink rising up to their mouth. In other words, this is a respectful way of saying <vocabulary>to eat</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to drink</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a combination of the words 召す and 上がる that you've learned already.召す becomes 召し and then you add 上がる to it. Pretty straightforward, right?",
