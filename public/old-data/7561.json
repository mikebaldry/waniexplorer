  "meaningMnemonic": "This word has two different meanings. <vocabulary>One day</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>first day</vocabulary>. No matter how you look at this word, those meanings make a lot of sense.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The first meaning is <vocabulary>one day</vocabulary>, and it has the same reading as the kanji you learned, so you should already know this reading.\n\nThe reading for ”first day,\" however, is a big old exception. It doesn’t take the on’yomi or kun’yomi readings, and has its own special (weird) readings. Here’s a mnemonic to help  you remember this one:\n\nOn the <vocabulary>first day</vocabulary> of a new relationship you just <reading>tweet a chee</reading>sy (ついたち) line at each other. You're so in love you can't speak normally, so you just use bird calls and cheesy lines to communicate.",
