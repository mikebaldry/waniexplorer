Especially if you're making a <vocabulary>photocopy</vocabulary> or a <vocabulary>carbon copy</vocabulary>. It's like a copy of a copy! \n\n複写 is a pretty formal word for copying documents, text, or images. It's still often used to talk about carbon copies. But for photocopies, most people just say コピー(する) these days.",
