  "meaningMnemonic": "The combination of kanji doesn't make perfect sense, but it's alright. Take something that's <kanji>middle</kanji> <kanji>old</kanji> and you have something that's <vocabulary>used</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>secondhand</vocabulary>. It's not 100% old yet... it's still in the middle, meaning you can give it to someone else to use, like your younger siblings.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
