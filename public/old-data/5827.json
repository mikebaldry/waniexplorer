Just know that small beans are azuki beans.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading doesn't make sense either. If you know that small beans are <vocabulary>azuki beans</vocabulary>, then you know that this is referring to a thing known as <reading>azuki</reading> (あずき). Other than that, there's not much else to do.",
