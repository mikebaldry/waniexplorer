  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>temporary</kanji> <kanji>name</kanji>s. These are the <vocabulary>kana</vocabulary> (that's hiragana and katakana). Why are kana the \"temporary names\" though? Maybe they were just meant to be a temporary way to write the names of the kanji you didn't know how to write yet. That's just a guess, but it should help you remember that this word means \"kana.\"",
  "readingMnemonic": "Okay, so 仮 uses the rare kun'yomi reading か, which you haven't learned yet, but luckily it's the same as the on'yomi you have learned! And 名 also uses a kun'yomi reading that you learned with the vocab word 名 (な). So you sort of know these readings already, but it's a lot to take in, so here's a mnemonic to help: \n\nThe reading is so tricky for <vocabulary>kana</vocabulary> that it makes you say <reading>かな</reading>… (I wonder…) whenever you try to read it. You keep thinking, \"Is the reading kana, かな? Or could it be something else, かな?\" You're just not sure.",
