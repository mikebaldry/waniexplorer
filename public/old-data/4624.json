  "meaningMnemonic": "It's both a <kanji>law</kanji> and a <kanji>rule</kanji>. This usually refers to something that is a <vocabulary>physical law</vocabulary>, but also can simply be a <vocabulary>law</vocabulary>, too. Anyways, lots of rules. Lots of laws. It's both, so the stronger one (law) takes precedence.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
