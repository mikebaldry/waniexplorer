When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nIn the sky, you are the ruler. You are known as \"The <reading>soarer</reading>!\" (そら). Imagine your theme song and make sure it includes \"soarer of the sky\" or something awesome like that.",
