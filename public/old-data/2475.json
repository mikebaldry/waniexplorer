  "readingMnemonic": "When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Since you don't know the kun'yomi reading for this kanji yet, let's use a mnemonic to learn it.\n\nWhat does a <vocabulary>person</vocabulary> hate more than anything? They hate extreme <reading>heat</reading> (ひと). You can always put on more clothes to stay warm, but when the heat gets too high, you can only take off so much.",
