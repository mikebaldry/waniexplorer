When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're looking at a natural <vocabulary>spring</vocabulary> in the ground. Water is bubbling up, but then something changes. It looks a bit clogged... something is poking out. Then, all of a sudden, Mario flies out of the springs, falls in front of you and yells: \"<reading>izumeeeee</reading> (いずみ), Mario!\"",
