  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you go <vocabulary>to judge</vocabulary> people, there are different types. The one you truly hate the most, however, is the <reading>sobber</reading> (さば). \"The Sobber\" is the worst kind. They just sob and sob and sob and it's really hard to move on to your next judging.",
