  "readingMnemonic": "Now that your shellfish is properly <kanji>pierce</kanji>d and turned into <kanji>sushi counter</kanji>s, you can serve them to Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (かん) and his men. I really hope you counted them correctly too, because there are a lot of them.",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Under the <radical>window</radical>, you place a <radical>shellfish</radical>, then slam the window shut to <kanji>pierce</kanji> its tough shell. This is the best way to pierce a member of the shellfish family, I promise.\n\nThis kanji also has a second meaning. That shellfish you pierced with the window is in two halves now. You can use those halves as plates for sushi. If you count the broken shells you'll know how much sushi you have. That makes them <kanji>sushi counter</kanji>s!",
