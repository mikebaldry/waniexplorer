  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>investigate</kanji> so the vocab verb version means <vocabulary>to investigate</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou are hired <vocabulary>to investigate</vocabulary> someone's wife. It is said that <reading>she love</reading>s (しら) another man... but you need to investigate her to find out if that's true, for her husband of course.",
