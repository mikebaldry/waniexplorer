  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that 埋まる is \"to be buried.\" This verb is also <vocabulary>to be buried</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to get buried</vocabulary>. \n\nHowever, there's a slight difference between them. 埋まる focuses on the subject itself getting buried or filled, while 埋もれる highlights the sense of something being hidden or obscured by being covered. So you could use it to describe a yard covered in snow or your talent being overshadowed in a competitive environment. \n\nYou can remember this nuance because it's <reading>more rare</reading> (もれる) to see something completely buried and covered up.",
