  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>model</kanji>, and the verb version means things like <vocabulary>to be in light of something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to take something into account</vocabulary>. If something is your model, you're taking it into account, and it's in light of it that you make your decisions.\n\nThis verb is transitive, meaning that it can take a direct object, but you'll probably see it used more with the particle に. It's a pretty formal word so you'll mostly come across it in official, written contexts.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This verb uses the kun'yomi of the kanji. You haven't learned that yet, so here's mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you want <vocabulary>to take something into account</vocabulary>, you'll need to <reading>考</reading>える (かんが) about it really hard first. Please think about it really, really carefully, because it's bound <vocabulary>to be in light of something</vocabulary>, and we need to know what that something is.",
