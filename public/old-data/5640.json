  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>extend</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to extend</vocabulary>.\n\nDoes the kanji look familiar, kind of like 広い, perhaps? 拡がる is the less common and narrower counterpart of 広がる. It's used to describe the enlargement or extension of the size, area, or range of something.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word shares the same reading as 広い. That means 拡がる is read as <reading>ひろ</reading>がる.",
