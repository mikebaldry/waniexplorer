  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that the kanji 田 means <kanji>rice paddy</kanji>, so it should be easy to work out that this word also means <vocabulary>rice paddy</vocabulary>.\nBut… what's the んぼ on the end? It sounds like ju<reading>mbo</reading> (んぼ), so let's say it's a cute ending added by Japanese rice farmers, to make their rice paddies sound bigger than they are.\nThis word also happens to be a common way of saying \"rice paddy\" in conversation compared to its formal version, which you will be learning soon.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word has hiragana attached to the kanji, which is a good sign that the reading is kun'yomi. You learned that reading when you learned the kanji, so you should be good to go.",
