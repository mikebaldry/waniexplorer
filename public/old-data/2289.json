You look into it and it turned out it IS a really big cork that centaurs use on their big wine casks. But the king didn't understand, and thought it was a hat. The centaurs are probably still laughing.",

It's a big, wooden <kanji>plug</kanji> that he's just placed on his head. It can hardly be called a hat.",
