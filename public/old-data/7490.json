You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember:\n\nYou jump on a wave and ride around the world on it. As you ride this wave, it gets bigger and bigger, until it reaches tsu<reading>nami</reading> (なみ) proportions. Imagine looking down from the tsunami at the vast, blue sea all around you. That's quite a wave you're riding.",
