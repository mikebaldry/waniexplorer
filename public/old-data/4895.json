  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>stab</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to stab</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning that you are the one doing the stabbing... should I be afraid of you? 😅",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading you learned for this kanji is the kun'yomi one. Since this vocab word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Guess what? That means you already know it!\n\nBut in case you've already forgot the reading, here's a mnemonic to refresh your memory:\n\nIf you're going <vocabulary>to stab</vocabulary> someone, use a <reading>saw</reading> (さ). It may seem more difficult to stab them with a saw at first, but when you see the damage, plus how hard it is to get back out, you'll realize saws are the ideal stabbing tool.",
