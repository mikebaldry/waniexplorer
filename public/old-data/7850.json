It's rude to start explaining who you are before you greet them.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 会 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen someone <vocabulary>bow</vocabulary>s to you, you always feel a little uncomfortable, so you say, \"<reading>Eh</reading>\" (え) and try to get them to stop. You're so uncomfortable that you can't think of words and \"eh\" is all you can manage to get out.",
