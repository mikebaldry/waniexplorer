  "readingMnemonic": "The reading used for 挿絵 is an exceptional one. Instead of そう it's さし. When you think of a <vocabulary>book illustration</vocabulary>, think of an illustration of a <reading>sash</reading>. Just picture after picture of a sash. Purple sashes. Green sashes. Flashy sashes. What a weird book, that only has illustrations of sashes.\n\n絵, however, is the reading you learned with the kanji, so at least you have that.",
