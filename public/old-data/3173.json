  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>self</kanji> <kanji>revolving</kanji> <kanji>car</kanji>. You'd think this would be a regular car, but <vocabulary>bicycles</vocabulary> were probably introduced before cars were, meaning the self revolving car is the bicycle, not the car. Just imagine yourself on a bike, and you don't even have to move the pedals. They revolve themselves, but now you're going too fast and it's scary.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
