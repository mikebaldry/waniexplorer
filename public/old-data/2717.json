  "meaningMnemonic": "You’ve already learned 仕方, which you know means \"method\" or \"way of doing.\" When you <em>don’t</em> (that’s the がない part) have a way of doing or achieving something, you could say it <vocabulary>can’t be helped</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>it’s no use</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>there’s no other way</vocabulary>. Makes sense, right? This is a popular phrase in Japanese, so we're sure you'll encounter it a lot!",
  "readingMnemonic": "You already know how to read this from having learned 仕方, so you should be good to go!",
