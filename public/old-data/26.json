  "meaningMnemonic": "This radical looks like the katakana character ナ (na), which we're going to say stands for <radical>narwhal</radical>. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Oh, and don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (ナ) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (メ), like an \"X.\"",
