  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>try</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to try to do something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to attempt something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis verb is transitive, meaning it takes a direct object. Here, the direct object is whatever it is that you're trying to do.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You know how when you try to do something you put your whole heart into it? Well, think of that in Japanese. You put your whole <reading>心</reading> (こころ) into it.",
