  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this one is fairly difficult, as it's the kun'yomi reading (you can tell it's kun'yomi because of all the hiragana attached). You have to remember the すく part to remember the reading of this word. Think of it this way: \n\nYou have a <vocabulary>few</vocabulary> of something. This something is <reading>suck</reading>ers (すく). Imagine putting all (three-ish) of them in your mouth at once. How does it taste? Can you taste the flavors from each of the few?",
