  "meaningMnemonic": "You just learned the vocab 生, meaning fresh. Combined with the katakana word for beer makes this draft beer or unpasteurized beer.\n\nNote that while in a lot of countries, \"draft beer\" refers only to beer that's drawn from a keg, 生ビール can also refer to unpasteurized canned or bottled beer, giving it a shorter shelf-life, but also keeping it fresh.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Be careful to use kun'yomi for 生 here. Other than that, as long as you know your katakana, you should be good to go!",
