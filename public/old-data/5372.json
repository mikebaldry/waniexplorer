  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a <kanji>purchase</kanji>d <kanji>read</kanji> — especially one that comes regularly. In other words, a <vocabulary>subscription</vocabulary>.\n\n購読 specifically refers to paying for a subscription to some kind of reading material, like a newspaper or magazine, so be sure not to use it for free subscriptions!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The on'yomi for 読 (どく) is the same as the reading in 読者. In case you forgot, think about how you just got a subscription to <reading>dock</reading> (どく) magazine. It's all about docks and dock related things. How exciting.",
