  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. It also refers to <vocabulary>cooked rice</vocabulary>, because you gotta eat cooked rice with every meal, so it's basically synonymous with \"meal\" itself.\n\nThis word has a slightly gruff feel to it so it's used mostly in informal situations.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're eating a <vocabulary>meal</vocabulary>... MMmm, delicious! What are you eating? Well, it's a <reading>Mesh</reading> (めし) net. Taste the mesh net. It tastes terrible. This is a bad meal. Feel it in your mouth. It's weird and meshy.",
