  "meaningMnemonic": "In the <kanji>ume</kanji> season, it <kanji>rain</kanji>s a lot in Japan (and some other East Asian countries). That's why <kanji>ume</kanji> <kanji>rain</kanji> means <vocabulary>rainy season</vocabulary>. It usually happens from the end of May to mid-July, when ume get ready to be harvested. \n\nKeep in mind this is a seasonal word unique to Japan and East Asia, so you usually don't use it to refer to rainy seasons that happen in other regions of the world.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses an exceptional reading, so don't try to read this with the kanji readings you already learned. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\n<vocabulary>Rainy season</vocabulary> is a special season <reading>to you</reading> (つゆ). All of your favorite things in the year happen during rainy season, like… staying inside all day because all it does is rain! But to you, there's nothing better than rainy season.",
