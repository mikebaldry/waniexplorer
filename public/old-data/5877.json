The kanji itself means <kanji>stagnate</kanji>, and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be overdue</vocabulary>. After all, if something stagnates, it's not advancing, which causes it <vocabulary>to be delayed</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Your work tends <vocabulary>to be overdue</vocabulary>, so you get a lot of <reading>to-do call</reading>s (とどこおる) from your boss, reminding you to do your work. These calls are pretty annoying, but at least your work is less delayed.",
