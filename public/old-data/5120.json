  "meaningMnemonic": "An <kanji>infancy</kanji> <kanji>child</kanji> is a <vocabulary>toddler</vocabulary>. The kanji are kind of deceptive since this isn't really used for infants. It's more for small children, from toddlers on up to <vocabulary>preschooler</vocabulary>s.\n\n幼児 is sort of formal, but it's commonly used to talk about small children from about one to six years old, or about that specific period of early childhood.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
