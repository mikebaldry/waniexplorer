When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You look up to see a crazy <vocabulary>illusion</vocabulary>. You can't believe it's real. Master Roshi, from Dragonball, is standing in front of you (you thought he was a cartoon!). Then, he splits into a million versions of himself, creating a <reading>mob of Roshi</reading>s (まぼろし). This mob goes on to train many people to fight.",
