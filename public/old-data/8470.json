  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>decay</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to decay</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to die out</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe entire world would start <vocabulary>to die out</vocabulary> if there were no <reading>coo</reading>kies (く) left! Can you imagine your life without cookies? The trees and animals would all die too. Because they love cookies. Not just us humans.",
