You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you are as mad as a <reading>hatter</reading> you'll need <vocabulary>to work</vocabulary> very hard to regain your sanity. You know The Hatter from Alice in Wonderland? Imagine how hard he would have to work to be considered \"normal\".",
