  "meaningMnemonic": "When you ask <kanji>what</kanji> <kanji>people</kanji> you're not actually asking \"what people?\" You're asking <vocabulary>how many people</vocabulary>. One thing you'll notice with Japanese and kanji is that 何, when added to other things, often means \"how many _____\" rather than \"what ____.\" Just something you have to know and experience a bit to catch on to, but you will, I believe in you.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi reading for 何 and the on'yomi reading for 人. Since 何 and 人 both have two readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\n\n<vocabulary>How many people</vocabulary> eat <reading>naan</reading> at <reading>Nin</reading>tendo (なんにん)? You've been tasked with counting everybody eating naan for lunch at Nintendo, so you better get started!",
