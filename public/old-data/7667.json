  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>lamp</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to burn</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be lit</vocabulary>. Just like what you'd do with a lamp.",

You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWho wanted the candle <vocabulary>to be lit</vocabulary>? <reading>Tom</reading> (とも) Cruise. He's afraid of the dark so he always wants all the lights and candles in the house to be burning at all times.",
