  "meaningMnemonic": "A <radical>sheep</radical> rides a <radical>tsunami</radical> in classic <kanji>Western style</kanji>. And by Western style I mean the sheep is dressed in a cowboy outfit and has put a saddle atop the tsunami wave to ride it. It’s a tsunami rodeo and this crazy sheep is riding that tsunami wave in classic Western style. \n\nThis kanji also means <kanji>ocean</kanji>, because presumably the people from the \"West\" who have \"Western Style\" came from across the ocean. They're the \"Ocean People\" in this sense. You'll want to be familiar with this meaning for vocab later on.",
