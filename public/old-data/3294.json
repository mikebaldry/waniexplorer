  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>fat</kanji> <kanji>peace</kanji> <kanji>ocean</kanji> is the <vocabulary>Pacific Ocean</vocabulary>. The Japanese language thinks this ocean is peaceful, just like English does (the word 太平 actually means \"peace\").\n\nNote that we're using the alternative meaning of 洋 here! If you didn't learn that with the kanji, just imagine that to get to Western Style places you need to cross the ocean from Japan!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
