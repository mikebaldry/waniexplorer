  "meaningMnemonic": "An <kanji>electricity</kanji> <kanji>table</kanji> is a <vocabulary>calculator</vocabulary>. Why is this? You can think about it in a couple of different ways. Maybe in the past, a calculator (aka abacus) would take up a whole table, making this \"electric\" version a calculator. Or, maybe it can be used to solve tables. Wrong kind of table, but should help you to remember the meaning of this word.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.",
