  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>separate</kanji>, so you can guess the meaning is <vocabulary>to separate</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be divided</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Remember the word 分ける? That word means \"to separate\" too. The reading is similar, though not the same, but we can at least use it as a jumping off point. We go from わける to わかれる. It's like we've \"separated\" the け and the る and combined them in the middle. け, making a かれ, which gets you to <reading>わか</reading>れる.",
