  "meaningMnemonic": "Your <kanji>stand</kanji> <kanji>location</kanji> is your <vocabulary>standpoint</vocabulary> or your <vocabulary>position</vocabulary>. \n\nNote that 立場 usually refers to the position somebody takes in a particular situation, but can also refer to somebody's position in society.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a bit of a weird one, since it uses kun'yomi and not on'yomi. What's more, how you read 立 is slightly different from what you'd expect. So here's a mnemonic to help you remember how to read 立 this time:\n\nTalking about your <vocabulary>standpoint</vocabulary> can be a <reading>touchy</reading> (たち) subject. You should watch out since people can get touchy when you give your standpoint on things!",
