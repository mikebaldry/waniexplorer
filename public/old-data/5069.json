  "meaningMnemonic": "When you <kanji>tighten</kanji> things up and <kanji>bind</kanji> things together, it's hard to separate them again. That's why this word is used <vocabulary>to conclude</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to enter into</vocabulary> important agreements, like treaties and contracts.\n\nNote that this word is quite formal, which makes sense, given the contexts it’s usually used in.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
