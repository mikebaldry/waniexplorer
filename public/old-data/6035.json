  "meaningMnemonic": "If 払う is \"to pay\" or \"to brush off,\" then the noun version is <vocabulary>payment</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>brushing off</vocabulary>.\n\nUsually 払い is tacked on the end of another word, like in カード払い (payment by credit card).\n\nWhen it indicates a kind of brushing off or brushing away, it appears in words like 足払い (sweeping an opponent's legs in judo) or, more figuratively, せき払い (clearing one's throat).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading comes from 払う, so know that and it will pay forward your knowledge to this one.\n\nNote that when 払い is added to the end of a compound, it becomes ばらい. ",
