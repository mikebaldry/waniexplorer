  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 万 and 人 both have two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\n\n<vocabulary>All people</vocabulary> have been <reading>ban</reading>ned from <reading>Nin</reading>tendo (ばんにん). Apparently they're working on something super secret, so now <vocabulary>everybody</vocabulary> is banned. What could it be?!",
