  "readingMnemonic": "The 鏡 part uses the on'yomi reading, which you didn't learn. To remember this, just think about how when you look down binoculars, you see something strange (like a strange reading for 鏡). That strange thing you see through these fantastic binoculars is... tomorrow. Your binoculars are so strong that you can already see tomorrow, <reading>today</reading> (きょう)!",
