  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>chirp</kanji> <kanji>voice</kanji> is a sound an animal makes. Sure, it works for birds (which chirp), but it also works with most other animals as well. So, we call this an <vocabulary>animal cry</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are those that you learned with the kanji. 声 gets changed to ごえ, though, so take note of that in your head. Perhaps you can imagine an animal that does a \"GOEEEEE\" cry.",
