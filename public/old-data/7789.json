  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you want <vocabulary>to shout</vocabulary> at someone you should pick a word that will really hit them. Give them a big <reading>whammy</reading> (わめ) to the face! Hey, that word works. Shout WHAMMY!",
