With this word, however, the on'yomi readings are rarely used now, so they sound rather out of date. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember the more common reading in contemporary Japanese:\n\nAnother place <reading>you saw</reading> (よそ) always seems better. In other words, the grass is greener somewhere else you saw!",
