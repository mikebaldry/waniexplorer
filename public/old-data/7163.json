  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>amass</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to amass</vocabulary>.\n\n蓄える means to gradually accumulate something <vocabulary>to store up</vocabulary>. So you can use 蓄える for storing up resources or knowledge, or even for growing a mustache or beard!",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to amass</vocabulary> things, so you <reading>take one</reading> (たくわ) and put it aside, then take one more and put it aside again. Repeat this process of taking one over and over and you’ll quickly <vocabulary>store up</vocabulary> lots of things.",
