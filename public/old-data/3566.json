  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. One of the kanji's meanings is <kanji>sing</kanji> so the verb vocab version of this is <vocabulary>to sing</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Awesomely, this uses the same reading as the reading for the vocab words 歌. Just throw the う onto the end and you have yourself the reading. So, sing your heart out and learn this word easily. \"IIIIiiIIIiiiII WILLL ALLllwaYYYs Loovvve YoOooOOooooOOOO ♬!\"",
