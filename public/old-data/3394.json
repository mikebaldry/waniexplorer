  "meaningMnemonic": "This word can be tough because it uses the same kanji as 着る (to wear). This word, however, means <vocabulary>to arrive</vocabulary>. You should have learned that meaning with the kanji 着 as well, so perhaps that helps. To differentiate between this and 着る, try to focus on the く. You really want to be <reading>coo</reading>l (く), so you always make sure \"to arrive\" late to parties.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This uses a different kun'yomi reading than the one you just learned (sorry). To help you, think about this:\n\nYou wanted <vocabulary>to arrive</vocabulary> on time but you showed up late. How late were you? <reading>Two</reading> (つ) hours and two minutes late, to be exact.",
