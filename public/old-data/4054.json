The <kanji>earth</kanji> day of the week is a day you find yourself close to the earth. Either you found you drank too much on Friday, so on this day's morning you're laying right on the ground of earth. Or, maybe you just want to sleep in after staying up late on Friday. Either way, this day you lay close to the earth is <vocabulary>Saturday</vocabulary>.",
