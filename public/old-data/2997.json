  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>help</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to help</vocabulary>. Don't confuse this with 助かる which means \"to be helped.\" You know that 助ける is \"to help\" because you're doing the helping. You know that you're doing the helping because you <reading>care</reading> (ける).",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to help</vocabulary> someone. Someone is hanging off a cliff and out of reach. They ask you, the person standing above them, to <reading>toss</reading> (たす) them a rope, but you refuse. \"TOSS IT!\" they yell. \"I WILL NOT TOSS IT,\" you respond. You're a jerk.",
