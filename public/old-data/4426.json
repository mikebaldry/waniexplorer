  "meaningMnemonic": "What do you <kanji>establish</kanji> and <kanji>determine</kanji> in your every day life? A setting. When you make that into a verb, you have the word <vocabulary>to set</vocabulary>, as in setting the temperature of the AC, setting your password, or setting your computer to dark mode.\n\n設定する is a little formal, but does get commonly used for device, system, and game settings. It's also often used in more official contexts, like for setting prices for products or establishing project goals.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Careful because the 設 gets shortened to せっ.",
