You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \"You gotta pray for Christmas presents if you want Santa to bring you some!\" \"<reading>I know</reading> (いの), I know,\" you reply as you begin to pray for presents. You should say this out loud to remember it better.",
