  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>below</kanji>, so you can guess the direction this movement verb takes: this is <vocabulary>to descend</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to go down</vocabulary>.\n\nAs a movement verb, it usually describes a gradual downward movement. For example, you'd use this verb to describe walking down a mountain, driving down a hill, or going down a river in a boat.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This verb uses the exceptional reading that 下さい also uses. So just replace the さい with る and you're good to go!",
