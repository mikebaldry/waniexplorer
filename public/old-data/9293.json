When talking about swimming as a general action, 泳ぎ and 泳ぐ are more commonly used.",

You've learned this reading for 水, but not for 泳, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe only way you can <vocabulary>swim</vocabulary> is by chasing after <reading>a</reading>corns (えい). If somebody isn't dangling an acorn on a stick right in front of your face, you'd never get the motivation to swim. Good thing you're this into acorns.",
