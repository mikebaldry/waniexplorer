  "meaningMnemonic": "及ぶ means \"to reach\" or \"to amount to.\" The noun version is more like a grammar thing, as it means \"<vocabulary>as well as</vocabulary>.\" Perhaps if you are reaching a certain point or certain amount, then you are adding things on. That's why this means \"as well as\".\n\nNote that 及び is a term usually used in formal writing.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading comes from 及ぶ, so if you know that one you know that one <vocabulary>as well as</vocabulary> this one.",
