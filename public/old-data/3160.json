  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this one is strange. The reading for 速 (そく) is what you'd expect (on'yomi), but 早 gets a reading you haven't seen before, meaning you should treat this as an exception. Just think about how you're learning this word <vocabulary>at once</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>without delay</vocabulary> so there's no time for any <reading>sa</reading>ss (さっ), just kanji learning.",
