  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 欠 means <kanji>lack</kanji>? This verb is related. The 欠かす form is a little tricky, but it's sort of like you're causing yourself to lack something. So it means <vocabulary>to do without</vocabulary>. Depending on the context, it can also mean <vocabulary>to miss an event</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to fail to do</vocabulary> something. Just keep in mind this word is most often used in the negative, like 欠かせないもの (things you can't do without) or 朝のコーヒーは欠かさない (never go without morning coffee).\n\nYou can remember 欠かす this way: Since you cause yourself to lack something with this word, it's all your fault. That's why you want to <reading>cuss</reading> (かす). You made yourself miss out on something. Well, $*%!!!",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!",
