Then you can always go back and look at the thing you managed <vocabulary>to achieve</vocabulary> or  <vocabulary>to score</vocabulary>, and no one can take it from you.\n\n収める means \"to store\" with an emphasis on placing something in their proper location. This nuance extends to convey a sense of accomplishment, such as \"achieving a favorable outcome.”",

You learned this reading with 収まる, but here's a mnemonic to remind you just in case:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to store</vocabulary> all of the <reading>o</reading>ld <reading>saw</reading>s (おさ). You were able <vocabulary>to finish</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to achieve</vocabulary> everything you wanted with them, so it's time to put them away so they'll be safe.",
