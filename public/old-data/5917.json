The kanji itself means <kanji>drunk</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be drunk</vocabulary>.\n\nThis drunk feeling also happens to some people in boats and cars. But we call that <vocabulary>to be seasick</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be carsick</vocabulary>. You aren't actually drunk, but you feel like you are (and you're probably gonna puke, yuck!).",
