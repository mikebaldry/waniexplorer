  "readingMnemonic": "部屋 is a bit tricky because it's one of the few Japanese words that use the へ reading for 部. You'll just have to remember this one is special. Here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nImagine you're renting out a <vocabulary>room</vocabulary>, but all you hear at night is a constant \"<reading>heh</reading> (<ja>へ</ja>)… heh... heh... hehehe\". An incessant snickering, coming from somewhere inside your room. Hehehe.",
