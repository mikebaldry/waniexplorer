  "meaningMnemonic": "Essentially you have the kanji <kanji>早</kanji> twice, because 々 is just a repeater kanji. When you have something <kanji>early</kanji> twice, it obviously has some kind of urgency to it. You'll need to take an action <vocabulary>as soon as</vocabulary> you finish whatever it is you're doing there.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is just the on'yomi readings (which you learned with the kanji) twice in a row.",
