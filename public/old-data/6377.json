  "meaningMnemonic": "A person with <kanji>genius</kanji> and <kanji>talent</kanji> is a <vocabulary>genius</vocabulary>, or a <vocabulary>person of exceptional talent</vocabulary>. So smart!\n\n俊才 is an advanced word usually only seen in writing. It tends to refer more to the kind of genius or talent that can be developed through effort. In that sense it differs from 天才, which is for the kind of genius that comes from heaven — either you have it or you don't.",
