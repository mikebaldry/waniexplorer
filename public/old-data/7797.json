  "meaningMnemonic": "Something that will <kanji>wither</kanji> and <kanji>dry up</kanji> ends up doing exactly that, <vocabulary>drying up</vocabulary>. And as it dries up, there's less and less of it until there's nothing left. This is called <vocabulary>depletion</vocabulary>!\n\nThis word is often used to describe situations where natural resources are getting used up and running out.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 渇 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf all of your plants are <vocabulary>drying up</vocabulary> you should just give them to your <reading>cats</reading> (かつ). Cats love to play with dried up plants. At least they won't go to waste.",
