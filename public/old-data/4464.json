  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>solve</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be solved</vocabulary>. By extension, it can also mean <vocabulary>to come undone</vocabulary>, like with shoelaces, or <vocabulary>to be cleared</vocabulary>, like with misunderstandings or tension in a room. \n\n解けるis an intransitive verb, so it doesn't take a direct object. In other words, you use it to say something is solved or gets solved. You can remember this because you don't <reading>care</reading> (ける) enough to solve things yourself, you just let things get solved on their own.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhile you're sitting there with no cares, waiting for things <vocabulary>to be solved</vocabulary>, you stare down at your <reading>toe</reading> (と). Really imagine looking at your toe while things around you are getting solved.",
