  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Absolutely</kanji> an <kanji>injustice</kanji>! We must <vocabulary>absolutely</vocabulary> punish the perpetrator, <vocabulary>by all means</vocabulary>. First, though, we should probably define <vocabulary>right and wrong</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word means \"absolutely\" when it's used as an adverb, and that's the use you'll hear most in conversation. However, as a noun it means \"right and wrong\", as in whether something is right or wrong, or good or bad.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
