So basically, an <vocabulary>electronic device</vocabulary>, or more generally, <vocabulary>electronic equipment</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>electronics</vocabulary>.\n\n電子機器 refers to complex electronic devices like computers, smartphones, medical devices, control systems, and more. So while it can be used to refer to a wide range of electronic devices, it's usually not used for things like simple household appliances like toasters or kettles.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
