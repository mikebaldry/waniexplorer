  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji means <kanji>extinction</kanji> or <kanji>die out</kanji>, but the verb version here means <vocabulary>to break off contact</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to sever</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to end</vocabulary>. Just think about how when you’re breaking off contact with somebody, you’re essentially making them go extinct or die out from your life completely. It’s such a complete severance, they basically stop existing to you.",

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIn terms of things you need <vocabulary>to sever</vocabulary>, <reading>ta</reading>cos (た) are #1 on your list. No more tacos for you, going to cut those off from my diet.",
