  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>shift</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be shifted</vocabulary>. You know that this is the one where something is shifted (and you're not doing the shifting), because it's really <reading>ru</reading>de (る) to be shifted, and you don't like it when people do it to you (because it happens quite a lot, strangely).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 移す, so use that to remember this!",
