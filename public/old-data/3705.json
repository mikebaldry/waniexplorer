  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>remainder</kanji>, so the verb vocab version is \"to remainder.\" Let's make that sound better: <vocabulary>to remain behind</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You decide <vocabulary>to remain behind</vocabulary>. Everyone else leaves, and you think you're alone. Then, someone <reading>knock</reading>s (のこ) on the door. Your heart jumps in your throat. They knock again.",
