Well, anything that's \"common-people-<kanji>like</kanji>\" is <vocabulary>ordinary</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>unpretentious</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>approachable</vocabulary>.\n\nUnlike 庶民, which can sometimes have negative connotations, 庶民的 is usually positive. It's used for things that appeal to ordinary people, like an unpretentious restaurant or a person with a familiar, approachable vibe.",
