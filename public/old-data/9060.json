  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>carve</kanji> and the verb version is <vocabulary>to carve something</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to engrave something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning it can take a direct object. You engrave letters into a stone, and you carve a scary face into a pumpkin. Those letters and that face are your objects.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Imagine trying <vocabulary>to carve something</vocabulary> using a <reading>hoe</reading> (ほ). Its long handle makes it a pretty impractical tool for carving. Now imagine all the trouble you have carving with it.",
