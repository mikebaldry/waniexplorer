You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you're trying to be <vocabulary>graceful</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>polite</vocabulary> you have to keep your secret <reading>shee</reading>p <reading>toe</reading> (しと) under wraps. You're kind of fond of your sheep toe (it's unique after all) but you're careful to hide it when you want to be all modest and gentle and all that.",
