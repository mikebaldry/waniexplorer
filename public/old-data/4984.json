  "meaningMnemonic": "Your <kanji>energy</kanji> is ... well ... <kanji>different</kanji>. That's the nice way to put it. You're <vocabulary>crazy</vocabulary>, actually.\n\nWARNING: We're teaching you this word because it's used quite a bit still (especially online) and we want you to be able to understand it if you see it. But please keep in mind that this is considered to be a discriminatory word against people with mental illnesses, so we strongly recommend you do not use or direct this word toward anyone. Think of it like a really inappropriate swear word that makes you really uncool if you say it. Please!\n\nWhile you still see the kanji version, this word is commonly written in katakana.",
