  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>paragraph</kanji> in <kanji>writing</kanji> is what you send someone when you want to submit a <vocabulary>complaint</vocabulary>. You want to make sure these are in writing, though, otherwise you don't have proof of your complaint. Also, don't make it longer than a paragraph, because that's too long and nobody cares about how you think the shop staff mistreated your dog Fluffy.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
