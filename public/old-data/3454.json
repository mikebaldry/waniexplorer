So, instead think of this word as <vocabulary>completely</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>entirely</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>truly</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe person who <vocabulary>completely</vocabulary> doesn't understand this vocab word is <reading>Matt</reading> (まった). Be sure to take note of the small っ, too.",
