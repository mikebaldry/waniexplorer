  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Wash</kanji> <kanji>wash</kanji> <kanji>powder</kanji> is the <vocabulary>detergent</vocabulary> you put in the wash you make sure your clothes are washed well. Detergent used to only be available in powder form back in the old days, and it still can be, so this is for that good powdery stuff.\n\nNote that this word sounds a bit old-fashioned. To talk about laundry detergent in general, 洗濯洗剤 is more common nowadays.",
