  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>hang</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to hang something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to hang up something</vocabulary> (as in to hang it up by a hook).\n\nYou can remember this because you must <reading>care</reading> (ける) about the way you hang something up. Without care, it won't stay hanging for long.",
