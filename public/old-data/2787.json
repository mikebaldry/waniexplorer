  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>study</kanji> or <kanji>learning</kanji>. When you do these things, what ends up happening? You learn. That's why this word means <vocabulary>to learn</vocabulary>. \n\nThere is another word that means \"to learn\" that is going to be more common, which is 習う. You'll learn this one later on. 学ぶ sounds a little more serious compared to 習う, so keep that in mind when you use it.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the まな part to learn this word's reading. Think about a class you're taking. It's a manners class, and you're there <vocabulary>to learn</vocabulary> <reading>manner</reading>s (まな). Imagine this study of manners and imagine yourself practicing it.",
