  "readingMnemonic": "You might think this is all going to be on'yomi, which it can be, but we'd actually like you to focus on the kun'yomi reading <ja>うみざかな</ja> here. Using the on'yomi is also correct, but sounds formal and scientific, while <ja>うみざかな</ja> is much more colloquial, so try to remember this reading instead! You already know the individual kun'yomi readings for this, but do watch out for the rendaku.",
