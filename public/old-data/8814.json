  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 手 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nTo be a good <vocabulary>pitcher</vocabulary>, all you have to do is put the ball into the <reading>chute</reading> (しゅ). Pitchers don't actually throw the ball. There is an invisible pitching chute right on the mound. You slide the ball into the chute and off it goes!",
