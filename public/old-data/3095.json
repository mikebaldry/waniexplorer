  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>Japanese style</kanji> <kanji>room</kanji> tends to be pretty small. This mainly refers to the kind of room that's covered in tatami mats, though. If you're looking for places to stay in Japan, a 和室 will be something like that. You'll pull the futon out of the closet and sleep on the floor. So comfy, these <vocabulary>Japanese style room</vocabulary>s!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
