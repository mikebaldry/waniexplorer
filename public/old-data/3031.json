  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>Someone</kanji> who <kanji>make</kanji>s is someone who creates things. Back in the day, a creator like this may have been known as many things, but the big one that stands out is an <vocabulary>author</vocabulary>.\n\nWondering about the difference between 作者 and 作家? Basically, 作者 just refers to the creator of a particular creative work, such as a book, article, artwork, piece of music, etc., while 作家 refers to someone who creates those things as an occupation.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 作 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nYour favorite <vocabulary>author</vocabulary> is also a <reading>sack</reading> <reading>sha</reading>man (さくしゃ). They do all sorts of weird magic involving sacks, and you just love reading about it. Maybe one day, you can become a sack shaman and <vocabulary>writer</vocabulary> yourself.",
