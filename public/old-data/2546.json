When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n\nYou walk up to the tree. You have to get inside, because it takes you someplace secret. So, you take out your <reading>key</reading> (き) and put it in the slot, opening the door in the tree so you can slip inside.",
