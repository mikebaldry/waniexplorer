  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>man</kanji> <kanji>person</kanji> is a <vocabulary>man</vocabulary>. \n\nThere's a の particle stuck in the middle of this word. Here it just means the noun before の is modifying the noun after. \n\nDon't worry if that's hard to remember though. Just remember 男の人 means \"man\" (and that it's more polite than plain 男). ",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 4 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.",
