  "meaningMnemonic": "Your <kanji>spirit</kanji>'s <kanji>degree</kanji> of focus is what helps you to hone your <vocabulary>precision</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>accuracy</vocabulary>, for some reason. Just imagine yourself throwing a ball. You miss the target. Hmm, okay... time to power up like on Dragonball. Up that spirit energy. Turn the degrees up on it. Boom. Awesome. Now throw again. Hit! You hit it! What great precision you have gained by honing your spirit!\n\n精度 is a relatively formal word, often used to talk about the precision or accuracy of something in technical or analytical contexts.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
