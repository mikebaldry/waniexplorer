  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>face</kanji> of a <kanji>face</kanji> is a face, but more specifically the <vocabulary>face of a person</vocabulary>. Probably because the most face-like thing you can ever have is a human's face... at least in our eyes (by \"our\" I mean the human race's eyes, because I am totally with you guys on that one).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 顔 isn't the one you learned with the kanji. But, we're going to learn that reading right now.\n\nThe worst thing that can happen to a face is if a face disappears. If it becomes totally <reading>gone</reading> (がん). A man that is walking up to you with no face, is a man with a gone face. Those men are men who are a part of the <reading>gone men</reading> (がんめん). Faces, totally gone!",
