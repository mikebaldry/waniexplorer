  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>rare</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>rare</vocabulary>. But, this can also mean <vocabulary>unusual</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>curious</vocabulary> (as in \"odd\" curious, not that you're curious about something).",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou know what's <vocabulary>unusual</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>rare</vocabulary>? This <reading>maze</reading> is <reading>ra</reading>re (めずら). I don't think there's a way out of it. We've been walking around for days now, and we haven't gotten any closer to the exit!",
