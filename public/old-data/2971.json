  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>teach</kanji> so the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to teach</vocabulary>. It's also used to mean <vocabulary>to tell</vocabulary> in a more general sense.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThink about your favorite teacher. Now think about them teaching you the following: \"Today I'm going to teach you about the <reading>ocea</reading>n (おし).\" It is big. Really big. Inside it are krakens, space aliens, and lost cities. \n\nHere is where you continue the lesson in your head, making it the most ridiculous lesson about the ocean you've ever heard. Focus in on the ocean part, since that's the reading, always coming back to it.",
