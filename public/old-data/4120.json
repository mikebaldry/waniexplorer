When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're standing around a <vocabulary>smoke</vocabulary> machine. It's billowing up smoke. Strangely, your buddy Bill Murray is here too. For some reason, he loves the smoke, and he puts his head in it, breathing it in deeply until he goes into a coughing fit. You decide it's time to stop him. \"<reading>Kay, Murray</reading> (けむり), it's time to stop that,\" you say.",
