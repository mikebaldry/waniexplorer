  "meaningMnemonic": "Another verb version of the kanji 閉! This is a special one that can be either transitive or intransitive, so 閉じる means <vocabulary>to close something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to close</vocabulary>.\n\n閉じる is for returning things that have expanded open back to their closed state. It's used for books, umbrellas, web browsers, and even eyes and mouths. There are some overlaps with 閉める (you can 閉じる or 閉める a gate, for example) but 閉める is mostly used for things like doors, windows, and curtains.\n",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is different from 閉める or 閉まる. Instead, 閉じる is read とじる.\n\nWhy? Because <vocabulary>to close something</vocabulary> that's expanded or spread open, you always use your <reading>toe</reading> (と)! It's easy enough with books, but umbrellas are a real challenge… But you, you can do it! You have the toe-tal control and can close anything expanded to the way it was before.",
