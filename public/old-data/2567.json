You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nImagine hearing someone to your <vocabulary>left</vocabulary> saying, \"<reading>Hi Da'ri</reading>!\" (ひだり) which is supposed to be \"Hi There,\" or \"Hi Dearie.\" You turn left and there's no one there. You hear it again, \"Hi Da'ri!\" Keep turning to the left until you find the person saying hi to you.",
