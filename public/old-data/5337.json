The kanji itself means <kanji>illuminate</kanji>, so this means <vocabulary>to illuminate</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to shine light on</vocabulary> something.\n\nBut don't get it confused with 照れる, which is \"to feel embarrassed\" — that would be embarrassing. You know this is \"to illuminate\" because you get a <reading>rash</reading> (らす) every time something shines on you too much.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Speaking of things that illuminate, your <reading>hand</reading>s (手) illuminate all the time for some reason.",
