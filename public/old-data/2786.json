  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>What</kanji> <kanji>times</kanji>? This doesn't make any sense. One thing you'll notice with Japanese and kanji is that 何, when added to other things, often means \"how many _____\" rather than \"what ____.\" Just something you have to know and experience a bit to catch on to, but you will, I believe in you. So, for this one it's <vocabulary>how many times</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word with a slightly unique reading, where the first kanji uses the kun'yomi reading and the second uses the on'yomi reading. You've seen these readings before, so you should be able to read this alright.",
