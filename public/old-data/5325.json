  "readingMnemonic": "The kanji stands by itself with a particle, meaning that this uses the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou know a person that starts every other sentence by saying \"<vocabulary>Furthermore</vocabulary>,\" and that's... <reading>Sarah</reading> (さら). Really feel yourself getting annoyed with this Sarah for starting every other sentence with \"Furthermore, ...!\"\n\nJust note that 更に is often written in kana, as さらに, especially in casual writing!",
