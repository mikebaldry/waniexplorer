  "meaningMnemonic": "<vocabulary>Fourth day</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>day four</vocabulary>. No matter how you look at this combination of kanji, the meaning of the word makes a lot of sense!",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Counting days, however, is an exception (at least up to ten). You need to use the kun'yomi readings to read this word. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 四, so that's fine (the ん gets turned into a small っ, though). Think of it this way:\n\nOn the <vocabulary>fourth day</vocabulary> of being lost in the wilderness, you start yelling \"<reading>Yo</reading>, <reading>ca</reading>r (よっか)!\" out of desperation, never getting an answer. You keep marching on, occasionally yelling \"Yo, car!\", but no car ever comes to help you.",
