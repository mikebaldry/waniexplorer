  "meaningMnemonic": "If you say something is going to <kanji>clear up</kanji>, you're usually talking about the weather. That makes this <vocabulary>clear weather</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>sunny</vocabulary>.\n\nMaybe because of those connotations, 晴れ can also be used to describe special occasions that are usually public. For example, a wedding or a big recital might be called a 晴れの場 (special occasion). Similarly, the special clothing you wear to such events is called 晴れ着 (formal attire).",
