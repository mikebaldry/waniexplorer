  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>call</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to call</vocabulary>, as in calling someone over.\n\n召す is an honorific verb, so it's used to talk about the actions of social higher-ups. 召す suggests the image of a superior who summons someone or something to themselves, hence the main meaning to call. But it can also be a polite way to say <vocabulary>to take</vocabulary>, like when they take a meal or a drink, and <vocabulary>to wear</vocabulary> when talking about their clothes.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf a noble decides <vocabulary>to call</vocabulary> you over, don’t look them in the <reading>目</reading> (め). That's super rude! To show respect when you're called, turn away your 目.",
