  "meaningMnemonic": "This word is almost the same as the kanji, but only half of it. It means <vocabulary>tag</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>amulet</vocabulary>. They're about the same shape and size as money, but you can't buy a house with them (...probably).",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n\nYou can't find your <vocabulary>tag</vocabulary> anywhere. It was just there, you swear, but now it's nowhere to be found. You search for it everywhere, then you realize... it was right there all along. Seriously? You're such a <reading>foo</reading>l, <reading>duh</reading> (ふだ)!",
