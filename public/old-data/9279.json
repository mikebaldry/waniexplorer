  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that 受ける means \"to receive something.\" Combine it with 取る (to take something), and 受け取る… still means <vocabulary>to receive something</vocabulary>.\n\nHowever, while 受ける generally implies passive reception, 受け取る carries a stronger connotation of actively taking possession of something. It is used when receiving a package or gift, or even when interpreting someone's words as having a specific meaning, such as an insult or compliment.",
