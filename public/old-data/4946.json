  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>river</kanji> <kanji>pig</kanji> is what's known as <vocabulary>fugu</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>blowfish</vocabulary>. You may know it from our mascot and best friend, the Tofugu!\n\nBut why does \"river pig\" = fugu? It's true that fugu usually live in the ocean, but sometimes they make their way into rivers near the ocean too. The \"pig\" part probably comes from their round, puffed-up appearance.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading makes no sense, really. Neither kanji readings work. But, if you remember that a river pig is a fugu, you can know the reading is <reading>ふぐ</reading>as well! YOU ARE A BLOWFISH, JESSE!",
