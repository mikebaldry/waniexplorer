  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>despise</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to despise</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThink of all the things you start <vocabulary>to despise</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to disdain</vocabulary>. Now come up with some <reading>anecdo</reading>tes (あなど) for each one of those things. Be sure to think in your head, \"I'm coming up with anecdotes for things I disdain, why am I coming up with anecdotes?\"",
