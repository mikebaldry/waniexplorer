  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this is pretty weird. 計 is all nice and normal, but 時 is と for some reason. It probably is coming from the vocab word 時 (とき), is my guess. But even if it is, it's shortened, making it a step more complicated. Maybe it's just better to imagine that your <vocabulary>watch</vocabulary> is a walky <reading>talky</reading> (とけい) and run with that?",
