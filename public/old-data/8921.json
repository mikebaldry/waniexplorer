And since you haven't learned the on'yomi for the kanji <kanji>蹴</kanji> (kick) yet, here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you're planning <vocabulary>to flatly reject</vocabulary> someone, one <kanji>kick</kanji> is all you need. Before you do that, be absolutely sure to put your <reading>shoe</reading> (しゅう) on first.",
