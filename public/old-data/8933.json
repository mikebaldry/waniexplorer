  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>suffer</kanji>, and the verb is all about when you make someone else suffer. That's why it's <vocabulary>to hurt someone</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to torment</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to harass</vocabulary>.\n\nYou need to differentiate this from 苦しむ, which is about when YOU suffer. You can remember that 苦しめる is about making someone else suffer with this mnemonic: Who made you suffer? <reading>She ma</reading>de (しめ) me suffer! She's so mean!",
  "readingMnemonic": "By now, you've learned 苦しい and 苦しむ. The kanji in these words all use the same reading! Yay! \n",
