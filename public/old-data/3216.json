So, when you think of a \"way of reading\" you can think of a couple other better words, such as <vocabulary>reading</vocabulary> (aka the reading of a word) or <vocabulary>pronunciation</vocabulary>. Anytime you need to know how something sounds, this is what you'll ask for.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 読む and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.",
