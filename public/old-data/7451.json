  "meaningMnemonic": "If <kanji>歩</kanji> is \"walk\" and you take <kanji>one</kanji> <kanji>walk</kanji>, then really you are just taking <vocabulary>one step</vocabulary>. When there's a number before 歩, it refers to the number of steps you're taking. The most common is this one, and you'll see it on urinals when they kindly ask you to please take one step forward because peeing isn't a game and somebody has to clean up after you.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is pretty standard in its trickiness. The いち shortens to an いっ and the ほ rendakus to ぽ. One step at a time, right?",
