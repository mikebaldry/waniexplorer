  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how <ja>掛ける</ja> is \"to hang something\"? Well, <ja>掛かる</ja> focuses on the fact that something is hanging, without specifying who did it. So it means <vocabulary>to be hung</vocabulary>. Use it to say a picture is hung on the wall, for example. \n\n掛かる can also mean <vocabulary>to be hooked</vocabulary>, whether it's the picture hooked to the wall or a fish that happens <vocabulary>to be caught</vocabulary> on a hook. \n\nThese uses are all intransitive, so you don't need a direct object them. A hint for this is that <ja>掛かる</ja> ends with okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja>, and those kinds of verbs tend to be intransitive.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 掛ける, so as long as you know that you know this too.",
