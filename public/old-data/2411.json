It's starting to smell, but the ocean breeze from the cape pulls the meat sack out of your hands and off into the sky (then probably into the sea too).",

No, not the kind you wear, the geographical kind. When you're on land, most capes look like turtle shell mountains sticking out into the sea. Do you know any capes like that near where you live?",
