  "meaningMnemonic": "This word takes the <kanji>reason</kanji> meaning of the kanji, making it <vocabulary>reason</vocabulary>. What's the reason for it having two meanings? I have no clue, but there must be a reason.\n\nWhile 理由 is the general term for reasons, 訳 tends to be more focused on the underlying reason or cause of something. It's also used when explaining a situation or when there's an implied need to justify or clarify something.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhat's your <vocabulary>reason</vocabulary> to <reading>wake</reading> (わけ) up this morning? Think about it. Now think of your reason to wake up tomorrow. What is it?",
