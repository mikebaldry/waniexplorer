You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou try <vocabulary>to obstruct</vocabulary> a woman coming your way (see kanji). As she gets close, she roars, \"I am <reading>Sama(n)tha</reading>!\" (さまた) You shall let me pass!\" You don't argue with Samanthas. Get out of her way! ",
