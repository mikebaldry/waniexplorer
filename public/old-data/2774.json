  "meaningMnemonic": "You'd think that <kanji>water</kanji> <kanji>color</kanji> would have something to do with watercolors, but it doesn't. No, it has to do with the color of water, which, ironically, is <vocabulary>sky blue</vocabulary> in English. <vocabulary>Light blue</vocabulary> works as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this word consists of the kun'yomi reading of <kanji>水</kanji> and the kun'yomi reading of <kanji>色</kanji>. For 水 you'll know this reading via your vocab studies. For 色 it just so happens to be the reading you learned with the kanji.",
