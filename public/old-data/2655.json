It's because they are an <vocabulary>expert</vocabulary> / <vocabulary>master</vocabulary> at something. How else does someone become famous or well-known? That's pretty much it, even if they're just an expert at being an idiot.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nDid you know that every <vocabulary>expert</vocabulary> has their own pair of <reading>May</reading> <reading>jean</reading>s (めいじん)? A true <vocabulary>master</vocabulary> of anything has a specific pair of jeans they wear only in the month of May. That's what makes them so good at what they do.",
