  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\n<vocabulary>Shell</vocabulary>s are a good defense against <reading>から</reading>て chops. You can't get hurt if you have a nice strong shell to protect you from that からて-chopping weirdo who just showed up out of nowhere. ",
