  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 添 is what you'd expect. The reading for 付 is the on'yomi reading ふ, which you've learned with 付近. But for this word it becomes ぷ from the rendaku fairies. Just think of an <vocabulary>attachment</vocabulary> where instead of a document or something, you get an attachment of <reading>poo</reading>p (ぷ). What a gross attachment. Your friend who likes to send poop attachments is dumb.",
