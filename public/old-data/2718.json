When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou need to go for a drive to the public gardens, but you aren't going to get your normal car, you're going to get your <kanji>other</kanji> car. Your <reading>hoe car</reading> (ほか)! It's a car made entirely out of garden hoes. You can drive it and hoe with it at the same time! Your other car can't do that!",
