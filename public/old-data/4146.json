  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>permit</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to permit</vocabulary>. It also means <vocabulary>to forgive</vocabulary>, in that \"I'll permit it this time... but only this time.\" Look out for 許さない in TV shows, too. It means \"I won't permit this!\" or \"I won't forgive you!\"",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I'm going to allow it. <reading>You're</reading> (ゆる) allowed to do it this one time, okay?",
