  "readingMnemonic": "You didn't learn this reading for 由 with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you had good <vocabulary>lineage</vocabulary> you'd never make a <reading>U-ey</reading> (ゆい) on the highway. That's dangerous, and people with good lineage and a long history would simply never do such a thing.",
