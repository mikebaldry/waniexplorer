That means they share meanings as well.\n\nNote that 程 is a word that works in conjunction with other words or phrases to express the extent, degree, or amount of a particular action or event. In less formal settings, you’ll also encounter this written in kana.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You'll remember this kanji to the <vocabulary>extent</vocabulary> that you study it. If you study it like <reading>Hodo</reading>r (ほど) would study it, you won't learn it at all. You would only be able to say \"hodor, hodor,\" over and over again, which isn't helpful at all.",
