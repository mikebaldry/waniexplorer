  "meaningMnemonic": "This one is a little strange. You have 混む (To Be Crowded), 混ぜる (to mix), 混ざる (to get mixed), and now this: 混じる, <vocabulary>To Get Mixed Up In</vocabulary>. It makes sense because it has to do with mixing, but how to differentiate from the rest? Well, for this one just imagine <reading>Je</reading>sus (じ) getting mixed up in a pot of soup. He's getting mixed up in this giant pot of soup because someone thinks that if they eat him, they'll gain his powers.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as (almost) all the other 混 verbs. All about mamamamama!",
