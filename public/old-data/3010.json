  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>anti</kanji> <kanji>versus</kanji>... You'd think this would be a double negative, but it's like a lot of other words where you have two similar words combined... it just means the same thing as those two words. In this case, the anti-versus of something would be the <vocabulary>opposite</vocabulary>. Alternatively, it can be the <vocabulary>opposition</vocabulary>. You choose.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
