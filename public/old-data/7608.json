  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 幕 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you try to peek through the <vocabulary>bakufu</vocabulary>'s curtain you'll only see someone's <reading>back</reading> (ばく). They all huddle together to discuss things so a row of hunched backs is all you'll get out of the shogunate. That's not helpful.",
