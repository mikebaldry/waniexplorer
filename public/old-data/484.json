That's why they can see the swirls on cereal, hear the music behind noise, and of course, look at things from the right side.",

In fact, some people didn't think they had mouths at all because they weren't looking from the right. Rookie mistake.\n\nSee how the \"mouth\" radical is to the right of the \"narwhal\" radical? That should help you remember that this means <kanji>right</kanji>.",
