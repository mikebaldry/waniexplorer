  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\n娘 primarily means <vocabulary>daughter</vocabulary> but can also refer to a <vocabulary>young woman</vocabulary> (often unmarried). This is because its original form is 産す女 (むすめ), or \"a woman who gives birth.\" Over time, it came to represent both daughters and young women.",
