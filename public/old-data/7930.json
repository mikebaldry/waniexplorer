You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe best way <vocabulary>to go through</vocabulary> someone's mind or a college campus is <reading>to run nude</reading> (つらぬ). So if you really want <vocabulary>to pierce</vocabulary> someone's mind and soul remember this!",
