  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji <kanji>degree</kanji> can mean both degree in terms of angles and degree in terms of temperature. This word is how you talk about these things. Just attach it to a number and you have yourself the number of <vocabulary>degrees</vocabulary> that something is. After the numbers 1, 2 and 3 (and in some other situations) this can also mean <vocabulary>times</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the kanji reading you learned. When writing out the answer to this reading, omit the 〜 as it's only there to let you know that some other word should come before it.",
