  "readingMnemonic": "This symbol doesn't really have a name, but it's sometimes called the のま because it looks like the katakana characters ノ and マ put together. If you know katakana then this will be easy to read. If you don't, think of it this way:\n\nYour mom is the <kanji>repeater</kanji>. She is trying to force feed you over and over again until you explode (literally). You keep yelling \"<reading>No ma</reading>!\" (のま) but she doesn't stop. She's on a repeating track, never stopping, repeating forever.",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: 人々 is actually 人人. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the <kanji>repeater</kanji>. It repeats what comes before it.\n\nTo remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a <radical>drop</radical> of water dripping into a <radical>prison</radical>. Drip drop drip drop. It does that over and over again, driving the prisoners nuts. But it never stops. It just repeats over and over.",
