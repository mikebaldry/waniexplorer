If you're streaming water, it might be <vocabulary>to flush something</vocabulary>. Alternatively, <vocabulary>to pour something</vocabulary> makes a stream of liquid, and <vocabulary>to set something afloat</vocabulary> is to make something flow in the stream.",

You have <vocabulary>to flush</vocabulary> them down the toilet. Imagine someone nagging you to do your chores so you flush them down the toilet, somehow.",
