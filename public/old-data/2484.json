You didn't learn the kun'yomi reading with the kanji, so for this vocab word, we'll use a mnemonic.\n\nThe most powerful man in the world. All his <vocabulary>power</vocabulary> came from his <reading>cheek</reading> (ちから). Imagine him blowing up his cheek like a giant balloon, then unleashing his power on you.
