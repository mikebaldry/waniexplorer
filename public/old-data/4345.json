  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>fly</kanji>, and the verb vocab version is also <vocabulary>to fly</vocabulary>. In addition to flying, the verb also means <vocabulary>to jump</vocabulary>. Just think of jumping as being some sort of... smaller version of flying, and this'll make sense.",
  "readingMnemonic": "When you try <vocabulary>to fly</vocabulary>, the main thing holding you back is your <reading>toe</reading> (と). It's like forty pounds and holds you down.",
