So, take the readings of 塩 (you learned the reading with the kanji) and 味 and you have yourself <reading>しおあじ</reading>.\n\nIf you happen to be a cooking show fan, you might also hear the on'yomi reading of this word - <reading>えんみ</reading>. This word can also be read as <reading>しおみ</reading>, which has more or less the same meaning as the primary reading you learned. ",
