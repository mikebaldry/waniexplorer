  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nYou can add this onto the end of someone's name. It's probably too polite, to be honest, unless you're talking to one of your customers or something. It's good to know, but you're probably not going to use it much, despite seeing and hearing it fairly often.",
