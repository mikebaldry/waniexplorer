  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how you learned that 縛る means \"to bind?\" Well, in Japanese being bound by <kanji>gold</kanji> means you're experiencing <vocabulary>sleep paralysis</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>temporary paralysis</vocabulary>. Just imagine that you're waking from a dream where you're bound up in gold thread, and it's stopping you from moving.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a combination of the words 金 and 縛る. Both use the kun'yomi readings, but 金 becomes かな instead of かね. If you can remember that exception, this should be easy!",
