Here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nHaving a <reading>sober</reading>(そば) person by your <vocabulary>side</vocabulary> is important when you're drunk. \n\nThink of other vocabulary words that use <reading>がわ</reading>. In these words, <kanji>側</kanji> is a suffix, so it will have another kanji that comes before it. \n\n\n",
