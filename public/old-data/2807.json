  "meaningMnemonic": "You have your <kanji>body</kanji> <kanji>power</kanji>. This is just another way to say <vocabulary>physical strength</vocabulary>. Watch out, if you use too much of your physical strength you may run out of physical <vocabulary>stamina</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>endurance</vocabulary> completely! They're tied together, so make sure to pace yourself.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nYour <vocabulary>physical strength</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>stamina</vocabulary> are tied together with a <reading>tie</reading> <reading>lock</reading> (たいりょく). That's a lock made of ties that ties your strength and stamina up together, making it much easier to pace yourself.",
