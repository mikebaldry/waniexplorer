  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>return home</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to return home</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to return</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to go home</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. You can return home happily, knowing how to read this word! \n\nThis word has a pair verb though, so you'll want to remember the る ending. Just imagine how <reading>ru</reading>de (る) it is when someone goes home without saying goodbye. The nerve!",
