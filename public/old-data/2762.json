  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n\nNote that this word refers to the grains of rice more than something that's a meal. If you're eating rice at a meal you'd call it ごはん. This is like when you're talking about the rice in the fields or rice grains or something like that.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\n\"Everyone, we have rice! <reading>Come</reading> (こめ) and get it!\"",
