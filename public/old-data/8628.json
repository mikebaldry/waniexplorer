  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. But 泌 is using an on'yomi reading you haven't learned yet (ひつ), which also happens to get rendaku'd here, so use this mnemonic to remember it:\n\nThe part of your body that produces the most <vocabulary>secretion</vocabulary>s is… your <reading>pits</reading> (ぴつ). Yeah, it's a gross image, but next time you're walking around Tokyo in summer and \"secreting\" through your shirt, at least you'll have the vocab to describe all that 分泌. ",
