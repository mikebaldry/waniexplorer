The kanji itself means <kanji>learn</kanji> so the vocab verb version means <vocabulary>to learn</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to take lessons in</vocabulary> something.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have <vocabulary>to learn</vocabulary> about <reading>Nara</reading>, the city of deer... lots and lots of deer. If you don't know about it, how about learning about it?",
