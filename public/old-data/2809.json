  "meaningMnemonic": "When you <kanji>make</kanji> <kanji>writing</kanji>, what are you doing? Simply put, you're <vocabulary>writing</vocabulary>. If you want to be fancier about it, you could say this is <vocabulary>composition</vocabulary>.\n\nNote that 作文 often refers to the end result of a writing process, like a finished essay, rather than the writing process itself. It’s also commonly associated with various writing tasks assigned to students in Japanese elementary or middle school.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since both 文 and 作 have two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\n\nYou can't stop writing <vocabulary>composition</vocabulary>s about <reading>sack</reading>s 'n' <reading>bun</reading>s (さくぶん). You're obsessed with them. You've been writing <vocabulary>essay</vocabulary> after essay about sacks 'n' buns. Stop <vocabulary>writing</vocabulary> about sacks 'n' buns!",
