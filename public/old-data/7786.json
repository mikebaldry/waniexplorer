  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. However, 定 uses a reading you didn’t learn, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you're having trouble with the <vocabulary>calculation</vocabulary> of your <vocabulary>bill</vocabulary>, just call <reading>Joe</reading> (じょう)! He’s surprisingly good with numbers, so whenever you’re lost at the restaurant table, just give him a quick call.",
