  "meaningMnemonic": "隠居 is \"retirement\". Make that a verb and you have <vocabulary>to retire</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be retired</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to go into retirement</vocabulary>.\n\nLike 隠居, this word emphasizes life after retiring, and usually implies having a quiet, maybe secluded, lifestyle. It's a bit of an old-fashioned word, but you'll still see it in modern writing.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
