  "meaningMnemonic": "You have <kanji>Buddha</kanji> and 像, which you learned mainly as \"image\" but can also mean <kanji>statue</kanji>. So that makes this a <vocabulary>statue of Buddha</vocabulary>. 仏像 can also just mean an <vocabulary>image of Buddha</vocabulary>, of course.\n\n仏像 refers to statues, paintings, or artistic representations of Buddhist figures used as objects of worship. While it often means Buddha sculptures, it also includes depictions not just of the Buddha himself but other Buddhist deities as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
