  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the た portion. Whenever we need to remember the た we use the word \"taco.\" \n\nWhat do you have enough of? What is sufficient? Turns out it's <reading>ta</reading>cos (た). Your bunker is filled with them and it's going <vocabulary>to be enough</vocabulary> to last the winter.",
