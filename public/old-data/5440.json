  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>How many</kanji>? <kanji>What</kanji>? In this area of <kanji>study</kanji>, you ask these questions a lot. This area of study is <vocabulary>geometry</vocabulary>, because you have to ask how many sides and how much the area is or something (can you tell I don't remember any maths?).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The 学 is read correctly, in terms of what you learned. The 幾 and 何 is weird, though. Just think how when you're asking a question in Japanese, you end the sentence with か. So, it's like, \"何か????\" and that's why it becomes <reading>か</reading>. Then, for 幾 think about how the <reading>key</reading> (き) to answering geometry questions correctly is figuring out \"how many\" sides something has. So, \"do you have the <reading>key</reading>か?\"",
