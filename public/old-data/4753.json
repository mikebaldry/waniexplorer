  "readingMnemonic": "The readings for this one are the kun'yomi readings of each kanji. 子 is こ, like the individual vocab word. 供 is ども, however. Remember this by thinking how much <vocabulary>children</vocabulary> love <reading>domo</reading>-kun (ども).\n\nAlso, 子ども is kind of more \"politically correct\" with the kana hanging off there. 子供 is still used in a lot of situations, usually stiff ones. The second kanji means servant, and some people don't like that. The second version pops up a decent amount, so it's good to be familiar with that as well.",
