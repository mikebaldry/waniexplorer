This word can also be used for that kind of figurative welling up, like of emotions, which is where the meaning <vocabulary>to arise</vocabulary> comes from.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou're fishing in a hole in the ice when suddenly the water starts <vocabulary>to well up</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to gush out</vocabulary> of it. A huge <reading>wa</reading>lrus (わ) splashes out and jumps on you. No wonder there weren't any fish! This is a walrus hole.",
