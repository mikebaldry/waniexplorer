  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nDo you know how in the Mario universe all the <vocabulary>bad</vocabulary> versions are called \"<reading>WARU</reading>\" (わる)? For example: \"WARUIJI\" and \"WARIO.\" That's because they are bad. They come from this kanji. So, if you ever need to remember this reading, just think back to Wario and Waruigi.",
