  "meaningMnemonic": "You <kanji>correct</kanji> the <kanji>moon</kanji> because it's a <vocabulary>New Year</vocabulary>. It's the beginning of a fresh year, so you gotta have the moon in the correct position.\n\nThis usually refers to the first few days of a new year, and it's one of the biggest holidays in Japan.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Both of these kanji have a couple of on'yomi readings, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\n\nAt <vocabulary>New Year</vocabulary>, you hate your <reading>Shou</reading>gun's <reading>guts</reading> (しょうがつ). He doesn't celebrate New Year, you see, so none of you get any time off. He even started a war last New Year and ruined everyone's holidays. No wonder you hate that shougun's guts.",
