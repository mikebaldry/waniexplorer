  "meaningMnemonic": "You've hopefully seen how 登る means \"to climb.\" So, if you're <kanji>climb</kanji>ing a <kanji>mountain</kanji> what is that? It's <vocabulary>mountain climbing</vocabulary>.\n\nIn case you're wondering what the difference is between this and 登山, they are essentially the same. The main difference is that 山登り is a little less formal, and is generally used as a standalone word, whereas 登山 can be used in compound words like 登山家 (mountaineer).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading comes from combining 山 and 登る together to form one word, 山登り. If you know the readings of those two words you know the reading of this word too.",
