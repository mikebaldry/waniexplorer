In this case, the 高さ is the <vocabulary>height</vocabulary> of something (while 高い is tall). This word isn't \"price\" though. For that you'd ask いくらですか？ (how much is it?).",
  "readingMnemonic": "Use the reading of 高い (たかい) to help you to learn and remember the reading for this one. They're the same except for the hiragana at the end.",
