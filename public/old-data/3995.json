  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a <kanji>build</kanji> <kanji>thing</kanji>, or perhaps a <kanji>build</kanji>ing <kanji>thing</kanji>. In other words, a <vocabulary>building</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>structure</vocabulary>. \n\n建物 is a very general word that can refer to any kind of building, including residential buildings, commercial buildings, or public facilities.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading might look a little strange, but makes sense once you get it. You already know that the verb 建てる means \"to build\", and that a もの is a \"thing\". Now just remove the る part from the verb to make it a noun, combine it with もの, and we get <reading>たてもの</reading>! Just remember that it’s all kun’yomi since it comes from the verb 建てる.",
