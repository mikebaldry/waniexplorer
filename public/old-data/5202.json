A <kanji>big</kanji> <kanji>mistake</kanji> is a <vocabulary>big mistake</vocabulary>.\n\n大間違い is less about factual errors and more about someone being way off in their assumptions or expectations. It suggests things didn't go according to plan — like you assumed a smile would fix everything or expected a date to go well, only for things to turn out completely wrong.",
