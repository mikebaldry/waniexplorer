  "readingMnemonic": "You're extremely <reading>chic</reading> (しき), which makes the fact that you're holding a cross while you <kanji>spread</kanji> your arms even more impressive.\n\nSide note: The official kun'yomi reading is just し but since far more words use しき, we're focussing on that here. It includes the okurigana, which is now included in the kanji in compounds.",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Taking a <radical>cross</radical> with a <radical>drop</radical> on it, you walk through the <radical>rice paddy</radical> in the <radical>direction</radical> of <radical>winter</radical> and <kanji>spread</kanji> your arms wide. You spread your arms to halt the approach of winter because your rice paddy is not done growing yet. You take the cross with you for some extra religious power of persuasion, and the drop in case any of that rice is thirsty.",
