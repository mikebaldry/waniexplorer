  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>use</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to use</vocabulary>. If you're talking about money, this can also mean <vocabulary>to spend</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\n<reading>Two car</reading>s (つか), are what you have <vocabulary>to use</vocabulary> because you're so huge you don't fit into one. You've got a British car on your left and an American car on your right, and you're driving them both at the same time.",
