  "meaningMnemonic": "You already know that 無我 is \"selflessness\" and 夢中 is \"crazy about.\" So this means something like <vocabulary>total absorption</vocabulary>. You're so into something that you’ve started losing your sense of self. Just like 夢中, this can also describe doing something <vocabulary>frantic</vocabulary>ally, like running away from somebody or something.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
