  "meaningMnemonic": "The one true <kanji>sovereign</kanji> is the <vocabulary>Japanese emperor</vocabulary>, a.k.a. the <vocabulary>emperor of Japan</vocabulary>. On its own, 帝 only refers to him, not to other emperors around the world.\n\n帝 is a classical term for the emperor in Japan. It's found in works of classical literature, historical novels, or period dramas that are set in feudal Japan. In modern Japanese, the Japanese emperor is called 天皇.",
  "readingMnemonic": "To remember the reading, think about how the <vocabulary>Japanese Emperor</vocabulary>, can always pull out his \"<reading>me card</reading>\" (みかど) when he's in trouble. It's kind of like how a \"trump card\" is the one that's above all the others, but with the emperor he's always up there, so it's a \"me card\" to him. And who's gonna argue with the emperor? Not me.",
