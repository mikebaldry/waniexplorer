  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>copy</kanji> so you know this means <vocabulary>to copy</vocabulary>. You know this word means \"to copy\" because it ends with す. You're copying the documents you need to <reading>sue</reading> (す) someone who screwed you over.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the うつ part. To remember that, think of yourself as a beatboxer. You're saying <reading>うつ</reading>うつうつ over and over again. Thing is, the other beatboxer is going <vocabulary>to copy</vocabulary> everything you do. That's why you're suing him.",
