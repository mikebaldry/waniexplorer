  "meaningMnemonic": "You've probably seen the word 回る, which means \"to revolve.\" This word is similar, except for you're doing the turning/rotating action on something else. You can simply say <vocabulary>to turn something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to rotate something</vocabulary> when answering this question, but be sure to think of yourself actually turning/rotating something. Remember this by using the す on the end. You've taken your friend <reading>Sue</reading> and put her on a stick. You're rotating her over a fire on a spit because you're a sick cannibal.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the word 回る (まわ). So long as you know that level 5 word, you'll be able to read this one as well. Use both of these words together to remember their readings.",
