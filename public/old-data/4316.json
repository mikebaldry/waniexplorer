It's a <vocabulary>conger eel</vocabulary>, a type of tasty eel eaten in Japan. It might be easier to learn the reading first, though, and use that, because the second meaning option is <vocabulary>anago</vocabulary>, the Japanese word for it (also used in English).",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the two kun'yomi vocab readings combined. So, 穴 and 子 to combine make あなご. Just watch out for rendaku, which changes the reading of 子 from こ to ご.",
