You learned this reading with the kanji, but here’s a mnemonic in case you need a refresher:\n\nYou look at the floor. It's disgusting. Dirtiest and nastiest floor you've ever seen. You say <reading>yucka</reading> (ゆか) because it's covered in <reading>yucca</reading> (ゆか). Plus, it's all rotten. Yucka!",
