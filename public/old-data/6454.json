  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>abstain</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to abstain</vocabulary> as well!\n\n控える is super versatile. It can mean <vocabulary>to refrain</vocabulary> from drinking, <vocabulary>to hold back</vocabulary>  comments, or <vocabulary>to stand by</vocabulary> (abstaining from taking action). In some contexts, it can even mean \"to take a memo\" because memo-taking is like putting information on standby!",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already, good for you!",
