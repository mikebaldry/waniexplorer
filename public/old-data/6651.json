  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>bathe</kanji> <kanji>clothes</kanji> are clothes you wear to and from the bath. They're your <vocabulary>yukata</vocabulary>.\n\n浴衣 originated as robes worn in a steam bath (that explains the kanji), but these days people mostly wear them at summer festivals or traditional Japanese inns. Be careful not to mix up 浴衣 with 着物, which are much more formal and elaborate!",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is totally an exception. The reading comes from the meaning, though. Yukata = ゆかた.",
