  "meaningMnemonic": "The 電 is what powers electric things. Many times, these electric things light up (especially back in the day, when electricity did this a lot more than other things). So, you have \"lighting.\" Then, you have <kanji>decorate</kanji>. So, if you decorate with lighting, you have <vocabulary>decorative lighting</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is quite a specific word that is generally used as a product category for decorative lighting. It’s a less common word than other expressions, such as デコレーションライト or イルミネーションライト.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
