  "meaningMnemonic": "An <kanji>ice</kanji> <kanji>river</kanji> is some ice that moves (very slowly) like a river. That is a <vocabulary>glacier</vocabulary>. In fact, many inlets and sounds were created with glaciers, because glaciers moved through them like rivers... not very quickly, though.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 氷 is the one you didn't learn. Think of the glacier coming slowly to your door. It rings your doorbell and says <reading>heyo</reading> (ひょう). Note that the か becomes が here.",
