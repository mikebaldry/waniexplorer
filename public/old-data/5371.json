  "meaningMnemonic": "You <kanji>purchase</kanji> <em>and</em> <kanji>buy</kanji> something? That's some serious <vocabulary>purchasing</vocabulary>.\n\n購買 is a formal term for the act of purchasing goods or services, mostly in business or economic contexts. It's often combined with another word, like in 購買意欲 (consumer appetite) or 購買力 (purchasing power).\n\nIn some contexts, 購買 can also refer to a <vocabulary>school shop</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>campus store</vocabulary>, especially in high schools or universities.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is on'yomi, which is great for 購 but not as great for 買. Luckily, the reading for 買 is <reading>buy</reading> (ばい), which is the same as the meaning, which is a pretty awesome coincidence.",
