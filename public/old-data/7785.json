  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe only thing a <vocabulary>great</vocabulary> person doesn't do is make <reading>error</reading>s (えら). That's what makes them so great. They can always sense when an error is about to happen and they correct it before it even has a chance!",
