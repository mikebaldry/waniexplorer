  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Who are you begging to have pity on you? It's <reading>NASA</reading>. They have you hanging outside of the space station and they're going to push you towards earth where you'll burn up in the atmosphere. You don't want that, so you beg mission control for some <vocabulary>pity</vocabulary>. What will they do? You decide.",
