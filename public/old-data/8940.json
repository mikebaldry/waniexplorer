  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>obey</kanji>, but the verb meaning is a bit different. In most contexts, it often just means <vocabulary>to be accompanied by</vocabulary> someone or <vocabulary>to have in tow</vocabulary>. To help you remember this, imagine that everyone you're accompanied by obeys you! You're sort of their leader, so you go everywhere with them following in tow.\n\n従える is a relatively formal word that's often used in literature.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading with 従う. Remember it?\n",
