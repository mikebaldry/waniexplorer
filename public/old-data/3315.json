You might also call it the <vocabulary>bathroom</vocabulary>, the <vocabulary>toilet</vocabulary>, the lavatory, or the facilities.\n\nThis word is casual and can often sound gruff, so you won't normally see it on official signs or hear it in polite conversation. It's worth knowing so you can understand it in casual speaking and writing though.",
