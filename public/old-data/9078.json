  "meaningMnemonic": "If you <kanji>mix</kanji> and <kanji>substitute</kanji> two people, that's a <vocabulary>change</vocabulary> of personnel, or a <vocabulary>substitution</vocabulary>. Perhaps those people are even working in <vocabulary>shift</vocabulary>s, so they mix and substitute each other at regular intervals.\n\nYou'll see this word in pretty diverse contexts, because it can refer to anything from a change of political regime, to the substitution of a player during a match, to factory shifts. The underlying meaning is that one person or group is switched out with another.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 代 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nA <vocabulary>change</vocabulary> calls for a <reading>tie</reading> (たい). If you're the new company president, or you're going in to work to start your shift, you'd better make sure you look the part, so get that tie nice and straight.",
