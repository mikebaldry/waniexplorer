  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou start <vocabulary>to scorn</vocabulary> your boss because she's been wearing that same <reading>sage su</reading>it (さげす) for a month now. She knows you want to wear a sage suit too but you can't wear the same color as her! It's really making you start to despise her. Uhg!",
