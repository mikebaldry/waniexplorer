  "readingMnemonic": "You spend a few hours making sure the water-to-dirt ratio is perfectly <kanji>equal</kanji>, not for yourself, but because the <reading>Kin</reading>g (きん) of England told you to. You may agree that equality is important, but it's the King's responsibility to keep things that way. Which is why he ordered you, small peon, to do the equalizing work for him.",

If there's too much dirt outside the pool and not enough water inside, it's gonna look weird. We can't have that.",
