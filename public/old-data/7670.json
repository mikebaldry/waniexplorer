You have to do them outside on the grass because if you did them anywhere else you might break something.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is a combination of on'yomi and kun'yomi. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this. Just watch out because rendaku makes くさ become ぐさ.",
