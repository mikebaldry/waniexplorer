  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You can also say it's <vocabulary>scarlet red</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>blood</vocabulary> as well, though more in a poetic sense, I'd say. I don't think you'll hear surgeons calling blood 朱.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading あけ is like the beginning of 開ける, which means \"to open.\" Just imagine you're opening (あけ) a person up, and out gushes a <vocabulary>vermilion</vocabulary> colored <vocabulary>blood</vocabulary>. You shouldn't open people up like that.",
