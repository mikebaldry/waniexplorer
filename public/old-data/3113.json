  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>ride</kanji> so this word has to do with riding. There's another word that's similar (乗る which means to ride). This particular one is transitive, meaning there is a direct object. The action is done to someone or something. So this means <vocabulary>to give someone a ride</vocabulary> when it's used for people, and <vocabulary>to place something on</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to load something</vocabulary> when it's used for things. \n\nUse the せ as a hint. The せ is a \"sail\" (せ) that you use on your boat to give someone a ride. How nice of you.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is kun'yomi (see that hiragana?) but that's the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be okay with this. Allow me to give you a ride to the next item to study.",
