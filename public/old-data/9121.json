  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji means <kanji>certain</kanji>, but when it's used as a standalone word, or after a family name, it means things like <vocabulary>someone or other</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>you-know-who</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>something</vocabulary>. It's basically a vague way to refer to someone who's name you've forgotten, or you don't want to mention for some reason.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi of the kanji, and you haven't learned that yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou bump into <vocabulary>someone or other</vocabulary>, and just as you're wondering what on earth her name is, her <reading>nanny gashe</reading>s (なにがし) her on the leg. It looks like it hurts. Poor <vocabulary>you-know-who</vocabulary>, whatever her name is. The nanny looks horrified, and is trying to patch her up.",
