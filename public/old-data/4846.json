  "meaningMnemonic": "Something is a trouble (面倒) and it is smelly (臭い). So what is something that's smelly and a trouble? Well, something that's <vocabulary>troublesome</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>a bother</vocabulary>, I suppose. Basically you can ignore the smelly part. For some reason someone threw that back in, but smelly things are a bother, I suppose.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the words 面倒 plus 臭い added together. Just make sure you know those words and you'll know this one too!",
