  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a fun one. <kanji>Water</kanji> <kanji>silver</kanji> is <vocabulary>mercury</vocabulary>, which makes a lot of sense. Mercury is liquidy like water, but it is all silver like silver. So silver water isn't some new mineral water you can get for $4 at the store, it's <vocabulary>mercury</vocabulary>! Or <vocabulary>quicksilver</vocabulary>, if you prefer.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
