  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf someone comes up to you and says, \"Hey it looks like you've really started to expand around the middle.\" Go ahead and say a big old, \"<reading>F@#$</reading> (ふく) you!\" If someone is rude to you, dish it right back out. F@#$ that guy!",
