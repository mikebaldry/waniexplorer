  "meaningMnemonic": "You know 初 means <kanji>first</kanji>, and に can mark a point in time. So 初めに means <vocabulary>at first</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>in the beginning</vocabulary>. \n\n初めに has a lot of overlap with 始めに. But while 始めに is for the beginning of some larger process, 初めに refers more to doing something first or to the initial point of a certain time frame. You might say 初めにアクビをしたのは私です (I was the one who yawned first), for example, or 今年の初めに (at the start of this year).",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you out. What are you beginning? You are beginning <reading>Haj</reading> (はじ). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja).",
