  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>man</kanji> made of <kanji>iron</kanji> is a <vocabulary>strong man</vocabulary>... aka a huge <vocabulary>badass</vocabulary>. Have you seen \"Iron Chef?\" The Japanese translation is 料理の鉄人, which means \"Chef Iron Man\" aka \"Chef Badass,\" at least in my book.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nCheck out the <vocabulary>strong man</vocabulary> wearing nothing but <reading>jean</reading>s (じん). He looks like a badass in his jeans, flexing his pecs. Very impressive, but also slightly terrifying.",
