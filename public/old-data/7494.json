  "meaningMnemonic": "Rhythm is 律動, but by adding a 的 in there we get the adjective version of that word, making it <vocabulary>rhythmical</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>rhythmic</vocabulary>.\n\nNote that リズミカル and テンポのいい are much more common words to use for \"rhythmical\" and “rhythmic” respectively, but you may sometimes see 律動的 in formal writing.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 律動. The 的 part you should also be able to read by now.",
