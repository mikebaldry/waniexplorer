  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>misguided</kanji>, but the verb version is usually used to describe how you feel after being misguided — <vocabulary>to be at a loss</vocabulary>!\n\n惑う usually refers to being in a quandary or a state of confusion. Using 惑う is kind of old-fashioned, but other forms like 惑わせる and 逃げ惑う (to flee frantically) are still fairly common in modern Japanese.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you are going <vocabulary>to be at a loss</vocabulary> you're going to be <reading>mad</reading> (まど) about it, most likely. Nobody likes to feel at a loss, so imagine how mad you feel when you are.",
