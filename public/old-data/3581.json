You <vocabulary>really like</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>like a lot</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>love</vocabulary> something.\n\nThis is the same as 好き in that a more literal translation would be <vocabulary>lovable</vocabulary>, but it's generally translated as a verb in English.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading comes from 好き which you've hopefully seen. Then, 大 is the reading you learned with the kanji.",
