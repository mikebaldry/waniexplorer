  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>stab</kanji> so the verb vocab version must also be <vocabulary>to stab</vocabulary>.\n\nWondering how it's different from 刺す? 突く refers to the act of pushing or pressing something with a tip of an object, often done forcefully and swiftly. So when you use 突く as in \"to stab,\" your focus is on the forcefulness of the action. On the other hand, 刺す focuses more on the actual act of piercing into something or someone with a sharp thing. \n\nThis is why 突く can be be translated many ways, like <vocabulary>to poke</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to jab</vocabulary>, and many more. ",
  "readingMnemonic": "If you're going to get stabbed, don't get stabbed <reading>two</reading> (つ) times. You can remember that this is the \"two time stab\" stab because it has a hole that's big. The hole is big because you got stabbed twice.",
