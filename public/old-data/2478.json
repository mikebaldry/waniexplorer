  "meaningMnemonic": "The アメリカ part is pretty easy so long as you know katakana. It's the word for \"America.\" You know that <kanji>人</kanji> means \"person,\" so you can figure out that America + Person = <vocabulary>American person</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Often times, when two kanji come together to form a kanji compound (or jukugo), you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. This pattern works with almost any country as well. Just add 人 to a country name and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.\n\nAnd since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use: \n\n<vocabulary>Americans</vocabulary> absolutely love their <reading>jean</reading>s (じん), it's a well-known fact!",
