  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>sink</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to sink</vocabulary>. \n\nThis is a transitive verb, so it's used when you're sinking something else. You can differentiate it from the intransitive 沈む by imaging that you're watching an enemy ship sink, and they shout out, \"Who did this to me!\" You respond, <reading>me</reading> (め). I did.\" ",
  "readingMnemonic": "When you sink something, like a battleship, you go on and say: \"<reading>she's</reading> (しず) sunk, I sunk her.\" That's like your tagline, or something. You say it for some reason because you think it's cool.",
