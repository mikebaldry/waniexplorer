  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>surround</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to surround</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to enclose</vocabulary>.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nPeople <vocabulary>surround</vocabulary> you. They circle around you, calling you a chicken. \"<reading>Cacko</reading>! (かこ) Cacko! Cacko!\" Wait, this isn't the sound a chicken makes, right? You laugh at them, thinking their way of making a chicken noise is weird. Go ahead and join in with them and say \"Cacko\" with them as well.",
