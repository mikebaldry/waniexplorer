  "meaningMnemonic": "Here you have <kanji>both</kanji> <kanji>direction</kanji>s / <kanji>way</kanji>s. Every time you have to choose between something it's like having to choose between two ways. That's why this word is simply <vocabulary>both</vocabulary>. \n\nClose to the kanji is the meaning <vocabulary>both sides</vocabulary>, as well. Learn either for 両方, they're pretty similar.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.",
