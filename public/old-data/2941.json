Think of it this way, if you \"fault\" something, you're messing up. What's a great way to mess up? By losing something. That's why this word means <vocabulary>to lose</vocabulary>. \n\nPretend like you are supposed to hold on to someone's wedding ring. You make the biggest fault of all. You lose it. Ouch.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nSo how did you lose the wedding ring anyway? Well... it was eaten by a cow.
