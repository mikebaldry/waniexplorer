  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You don't know the on'yomi reading of 湯, though, so just think about how when you get in the <vocabulary>public bath</vocabulary>, you're in <reading>To</reading>kyo (とう), because there are a lot of public baths in Japan, and Tokyo is the most well known city there.",
