  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>equal</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>equal</vocabulary> (and also <vocabulary>similar</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>equivalent</vocabulary>). That \"similar\" one is a bit weird, because \"similar\" is not equal, though I'd lean more towards equal.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What should be equal above all things? I think each <reading>人</reading> (ひと) should be equal!",
