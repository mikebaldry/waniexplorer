  "primaryMeaning": "Spicy",
  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. That being said, this can also mean <vocabulary>difficult</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>painful</vocabulary>, often in a psychological sense, though it can be physical as well. I guess if you're in a spicy situation it's going to be a difficult one.",
  "primaryReading": "からい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Depending on the context, the reading for this word could be からい or つらい. \n\nThe からい reading is the <vocabulary>spicy</vocabulary> one that you learned with the kanji, which you can remember because spicy foods give a <reading>から</reading>て chop to your mouth. \n\nThe つらい reading is the <vocabulary>difficult</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>painful</vocabulary> one. You can remember this because <reading>two Ra</reading>s (つら) are way more difficult to deal with than one Ra.",
