  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>mulberry</kanji> <kanji>field</kanji> is a <vocabulary>mulberry field</vocabulary>.\n\nBased on an old belief that lightening does not strike mulberry fields, 桑原 (often recited twice, as in \"桑原桑原\") can also be used as a charm to ward off undesirable events, though it's pretty old-fashioned.\n\nApart from that use, 桑原 now mainly refers to the family name <vocabulary>Kuwabara</vocabulary>, like one of the main protagonists of the anime and manga series 幽遊白書.",
  "primaryReading": "くわばら",
  "readingMnemonic": "These are both the kun'yomi readings, but you haven't learned this for 原 yet. It's actually the rendaku'd version, so let's just use a mnemonic to remember it instead:\n\nYou know you're in a <vocabulary>mulberry field</vocabulary> when you see a bunch of capy<reading>bara</reading>s (ばら) rolling around in there with you. Capybaras love mulberries! Picture a whole family of capybaras munching on mulberries. Mm Mmm!",
