  "meaningMnemonic": "Put some <kanji>cloth</kanji> in a <kanji>group</kanji> and you get a <vocabulary>futon</vocabulary>. It’s just the kind of nice, soft <vocabulary>bedding</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>sleeping mat</vocabulary> you’d like to curl up on.\n\nKeep in mind that this word is different from the English version. We’re not talking about sofa-beds for your dorm room here. In Japanese, your 布団 is the traditional bedding you lay out on the floor at night and put away in the daytime. 布団 can refer to the sleeping mat, the <vocabulary>duvet</vocabulary> that covers it, or both items as a set.",
  "primaryReading": "ふとん",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for 団 is the secondary reading that went with the kanji, though, so watch out for that. If you can figure out the meaning of this word, chances are you already know how to spell it, so carry that over to Japanese.",
