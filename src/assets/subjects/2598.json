  "primaryMeaning": "To Understand",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word means <vocabulary>to understand</vocabulary>, which might surprise you if you remember that the kanji 分 means <kanji>part</kanji>. Think of it this way: to understand something you have to break it down into its parts to see how it works.\n\nWatch out, though, because whereas in English you understand something, in Japanese the thing you understand is the grammatical subject (it's doing the action). So, a more literal meaning for this is <vocabulary>to be understandable</vocabulary>. In other words, there's no object, and 分かる is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The かる ending is a hint, because verbs with かる as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.",
  "primaryReading": "わかる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhenever you try <vocabulary>to understand</vocabulary> something, you just start screaming \"<reading>WAAAAAAAAAHHHH</reading>\" (わ). It helps you focus and concentrate on what you’re trying to understand, to the dismay of everyone around you. WAAAAAAAAAHHHH.",
