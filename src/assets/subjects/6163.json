  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>avoid</kanji> or <kanji>dodge</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to avoid</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to dodge</vocabulary>!",
  "primaryReading": "さける",
  "readingMnemonic": "Each reading has a slightly different meaning. Here's some mnemonics to help you remember them:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to avoid</vocabulary> people who drink <reading>sake</reading> (さけ) all the time. Why? Because when they get drunk you'll have <vocabulary>to dodge</vocabulary> the <reading>yo</reading>-yos (よ) they spin at you. Sake makes you want to toss the ol' yo-yo around. Avoid them or you'll have to get good at dodging!",
