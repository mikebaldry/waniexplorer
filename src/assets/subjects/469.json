  "readingMnemonic": "To remember the reading for this kanji, we use the word Chewbacca to pull up ちゅう in our memory.\n\nIf you remember back to the radical 中, a stick was stuck in the middle of the mouth of something. Let's say it was your mouth, and when you look up to see who did it, there stands <reading>Chew</reading>bacca. He's even doing his Chewbacca yell. And it isn't a stick in your mouth, it's an arrow from his bowcaster. It just so happens Chewbacca's bowcaster looks just like this kanji too. Go figure.",
