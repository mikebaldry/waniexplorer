  "primaryMeaning": "Deep Red",
  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same, so this also means <vocabulary>deep red</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>crimson</vocabulary>. Additionally, it can also mean <vocabulary>rouge</vocabulary>, usually in reference to the cosmetic.\n\n紅 is also a bit of an old-fashioned and somewhat literary word, so keep that in mind!",
  "primaryReading": "くれない",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is where things get a little complicated. You already learned べに as a reading with 口紅. 紅 can also be read べに just by itself, and in that case, it means <vocabulary>rouge</vocabulary>. However, there’s a different reading that’s used for <vocabulary>deep red</vocabulary>, which we’d like to focus on here, so here’s a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nThere's so much <vocabulary>deep red</vocabulary> blood everywhere, there's no way of helping this person bleeding out. One might say, <reading>cure ない</reading> (くれない).  Just remember: when there's deep red everywhere, cure ない.",
