  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nIn modern Japanese, 衣 is more often used to describe the <vocabulary>clothes</vocabulary> your <em>food</em> is wearing, i.e. the <vocabulary>coating</vocabulary> on tempura or the <vocabulary>breading</vocabulary> on deep-fried foods.",
  "primaryReading": "ころも",
  "readingMnemonic": "What are clothes, really? Some people say <vocabulary>clothes</vocabulary> are the <reading>chromo</reading>somes (ころも) of your personal style — each garment carries information about your unique identity. Other people say clothes are simply the <reading>key</reading> to not being <reading>nu</reading>de (きぬ). What do you think?\n\nBoth ころも and きぬ mean \"clothes,\" but these usages are old-fashioned. Also note that the more modern meaning of \"coating\" or \"breading\" uses only the ころも reading!",
