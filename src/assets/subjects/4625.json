  "primaryReading": "そなえる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have <vocabulary>to provide</vocabulary> your friends with their own <reading>sauna</reading> (そな) because they don't want to use your shower. This requires you to go out and buy a sauna for your house (very expensive) just so you can provide your needy friends with what they want (a sauna). Feel angry you have to provide this.",
