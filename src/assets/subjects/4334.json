You're trying <vocabulary>to defend against</vocabulary> something from happening. That's why this verb is a little weird and means <vocabulary>to defend</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to protect against</vocabulary>. It can also be <vocabulary>to prevent</vocabulary>, too, but just make sure you're thinking of it more like you're defending something with your prevention.",

You should probably put out that <reading>fuse</reading> (ふせ) attached to that giant bomb first then.",
