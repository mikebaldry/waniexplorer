  "meaningMnemonic": "When you see this on a number, for example ７人 or ３人, you're using it to count people. Just remember, both 一人 and 二人 have alternative readings. From 3 and up it's just the number plus にん, like this. ５人 is ごにん, １０人 is じゅうにん, etc. This is the <vocabulary>counter for people</vocabulary>, which makes this word the <vocabulary>number of people</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "にん",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a counter, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nJust think of the sheer <vocabulary>number of people</vocabulary> at <reading>Nin</reading>tendo (にん). It must be huge. This really is just a <vocabulary>counter for people</vocabulary> that work at Nintendo.",
