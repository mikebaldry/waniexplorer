  "meaningMnemonic": "When you <kanji>borrow</kanji> a <kanji>house</kanji> it's a <vocabulary>rented house</vocabulary>. This could also be a <vocabulary>house for rent</vocabulary>.\n\nYou can use 借家 in conversation to formally refer to a rented house or a house for rent. But it's more commonly found in legal contexts, like in laws and regulations.",
  "primaryReading": "しゃくや",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji, but in this case the second kanji can be read with either the on'yomi or kun'yomi. This uses a less common kun'yomi of 家, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you live in a <vocabulary>rented house</vocabulary>, someone has to give you the keys and let you in and stuff. You're only renting, after all. And when they let you in they'll say, \"Here's a <reading>shack</reading>, <reading>yah</reading> (しゃくや) house renter! Enjoy!\"\n\nBy the way, in the secondary reading しゃっか, the しゃく changes to しゃっ. This reading is mostly used in legal contexts though, so しゃくや is more common.",
