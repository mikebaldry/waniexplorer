  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a little confusing for someone who didn't grow up with the Japanese language. You have <kanji>fifty</kanji> <kanji>sound</kanji>s. Then, they're in a certain <kanji>order</kanji>. So, these fifty sounds are the Japanese syllabary. That's hiragana / katakana, probably from back in the day when there were more sounds than there are now. So, the \"fifty sounds in order\" makes up <vocabulary>aiueo order</vocabulary>, where the \"aiueo\" is あいうえお representing the five columns.",
