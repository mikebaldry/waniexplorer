  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>continue</kanji>, so 続ける means <vocabulary>to continue something</vocabulary>. It's a transitive verb, so it takes a direct object. You can 続ける your work, for example, and you should 続ける your WaniKani lessons at a pace that works for you!\n\nAlthough it has the same 続 kanji, this word is a bit different from 続く, which is used for when something just continues on its own (like rain, or trends). It can be hard to remember the difference, so here's a mnemonic to help with you 続ける:\n\nYou only <reading>care</reading> (ける) about things that you can continue through your own actions. For those other things that just continue on their own, you're like, That's <reading>coo</reading>' (く), but you’re not that interested. ",
