  "primaryMeaning": "To Cave In",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>cave in</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to cave in</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to collapse</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "おちいる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe cave you're hanging around in is about <vocabulary>to cave in</vocabulary>! Right as you're about to get crushed you scream, \"<reading>Oh CHEESE</reading> (おちい)!!\" You can't swear for real or you'll go to hell when this cave in crushes you to death. And OH CHEESE felt right as your last words.",
