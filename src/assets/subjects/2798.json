That would be his <vocabulary>testicles</vocabulary>. \n\nThis word came about because tanuki scrotum skin would be used to pound down gold into sheets. Tanuki scrotums are apparently very good at this because they are very strong and very flexible. Strange, yeah? That's why Gold balls = testicles.\n\nAs you might have guessed, this word is slang and you'll probably want to avoid using it at the doctor's! It's a comical word that is used in casual situations.",
