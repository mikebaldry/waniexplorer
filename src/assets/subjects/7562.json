  "readingMnemonic": "Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:\n\nYou've been stuck inside working for <vocabulary>seven days</vocabulary> and today you finally have a day off. Your friend asks you if you want to go for a drive but you say, \"<reading>Nah, no car</reading> today\" (なのか), because you've been cooped up long enough. Seven days is too long to be inside.",
