Geoducks usually live in the ocean, not in a river, so they must study the order of water flow in order to determine the best sequence for making it into a river.",
  "readingMnemonic": "After extensive study of the <kanji>sequence</kanji> and <kanji>order</kanji> of water, the geoduck has determined that <reading>June</reading> (じゅん) is the best time to travel to the river. June is the best time for the temperature and atmospheric pressure to be just right for such a journey. In June, the geoduck will set out.",
