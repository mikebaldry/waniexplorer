  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>pass through</kanji> but we already know the word 通る which means to pass through. This word means a different kind of passing through, like how you pass through the halls of your school everyday. But we don't say to pass through school, we say <vocabulary>to attend</vocabulary> school, or <vocabulary>to commute</vocabulary> to school.",
  "primaryReading": "かよう",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use one of the kun'yomi readings. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou live in the middle of three different school districts so you need to decide which of the three schools you want <vocabulary>to attend</vocabulary>. You decide you don't mind that you have <vocabulary>to commute</vocabulary> to the farthest of the three because their mascot is Wile E. <reading>Coyo</reading>te (かよ). He's your favorite Looney Toon because he always has the energy <vocabulary>to go back and forth</vocabulary> after that road runner.\n",
