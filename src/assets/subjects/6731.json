  "primaryMeaning": "To Sink Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>sink</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to sink something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to submerge something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning it takes a direct object. So instead of describing something sinking on its own, you use 沈める when you sink an enemy ship or submerge yourself in a bathtub. \n\nYou know this because you can't sink anything until you get that <reading>mail</reading> (める) saying, \"Yes, proceed with sinking!\" You've got to have that mail if you want to sink something, or else everyone will blame you for the missing ship — or for you disappearing under the water.",
  "primaryReading": "しずめる",
  "readingMnemonic": "When you sink something, like a battleship, you go on and say: \"<reading>she's</reading> (しず) sunk, I sunk her.\" That's like your tagline, or something. You say it for some reason because you think it's cool.",
