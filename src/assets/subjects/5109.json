  "primaryMeaning": "To Line Up",
  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji itself means <kanji>line up</kanji>, and this is the intransitive verb version of that, which makes this <vocabulary>to line up</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be lined up</vocabulary>. You can remember this because you keep saying <reading>boo</reading> (ぶ), why is everyone already lined up? If you were the one in charge of lining things up, you wouldn't have <vocabulary>to stand in line</vocabulary> yourself…\n\nFiguratively, this can also mean <vocabulary>to be on par</vocabulary>, as in someone or something matches or is comparable in ability, status, or ranking to another (as if they are aligned side by side in comparison).",
  "primaryReading": "ならぶ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Only for you, when you visit <reading>Nara</reading> (なら), the deer there are <vocabulary>to be lined up</vocabulary> for you to inspect, as you are the deer inspector. If you don't know about Nara and its deer, you should look it up, they're pretty awesome.",
