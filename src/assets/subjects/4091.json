The kanji itself means <kanji>news report</kanji> so you could try to say \"to news report\" but that doesn't make sense. What does make sense is \"<vocabulary>to report on</vocabulary>,\" however.",

  "readingMnemonic": "The reading doesn't seem like it's the kanji's on'yomi reading, but it is. What an oddity! Do you think it's worth doing a news report on it? Koichi, reporting in on this strange reading that is readable by you right now. Signing off.",
