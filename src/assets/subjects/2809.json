If you want to be fancier about it, you could say this is <vocabulary>composition</vocabulary>.\n\nNote that 作文 often refers to the end result of a writing process, like a finished essay, rather than the writing process itself. It’s also commonly associated with various writing tasks assigned to students in Japanese elementary or middle school.",

You're obsessed with them. You've been writing <vocabulary>essay</vocabulary> after essay about sacks 'n' buns. Stop <vocabulary>writing</vocabulary> about sacks 'n' buns!",
