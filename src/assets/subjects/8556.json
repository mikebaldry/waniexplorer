  "meaningMnemonic": "In Japanese, <kanji>pickle</kanji>d <kanji>thing</kanji>s refer to  <vocabulary>Japanese pickled vegetables</vocabulary>!\n\n漬物 refers to <vocabulary>Japanese pickles</vocabulary> made by soaking vegetables like cucumbers, daikon radish, or eggplant in a solution containing ingredients like salt, rice bran paste, vinegar, and soy sauce. They're left to ferment or marinate, enhancing their flavors. In contrast, western pickles are simply called ピクルス.",
  "primaryReading": "つけもの",
  "readingMnemonic": "You already learned 漬ける (to pickle something), so just take the る off and shove the け into the kanji. You still read it, but it's hiding. It probably shrank in the pickling process. Stick some things (もの) on there and you know the reading! Not bad! \n\nBy the way, sometimes you'll see this word spelled like 漬け物 too.",
