  "primaryReading": "じゅう",
  "readingMnemonic": "When a vocab is alone and consists of a single kanji like this, usually it uses the kun'yomi reading for the kanji. But, numbers are an exception and they use the on'yomi reading (which you learned when you learned the kanji). That means you know that this word's reading is <reading>じゅう</reading> already.",
