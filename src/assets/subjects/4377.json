  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>express</kanji> and the verb vocab version is transitive, meaning that it's done to something. So this verb means <vocabulary>to express something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to show something</vocabulary>.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou're trying not to say it directly, but trying to figure out how <vocabulary>to express something</vocabulary>. That something is that you <reading>are a wuss</reading> (あらわす). Sorry, had to be expressed.",
