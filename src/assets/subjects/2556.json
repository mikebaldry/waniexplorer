  "primaryMeaning": "To Take Out",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means \"<kanji>exit</kanji>\" and this is kind of a verb form of this. The word means <vocabulary>to take out</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to hand out</vocabulary>, so it's like you're doing the action of causing something else to exit (rather than exiting yourself).\n\nIn other words, this verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in す. You can remember this because the hiragana す is like the word \"sue.\" You're taking out way too much of something, and someone's going to <reading>sue</reading> (す) you for it.",
  "primaryReading": "だす",
  "readingMnemonic": "The part of the word that you have to learn how to read is the だ portion. Remember how someone was going to sue you for trying <vocabulary>to take out</vocabulary> way too much? Well, that someone is your <reading>Da</reading>d (だ)! Your own Dad is going to sue you if you keep taking out way too much stuff, so you better stop!",
