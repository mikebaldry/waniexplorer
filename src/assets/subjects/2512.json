This time, it just means the noun before の is modifying the noun after it.\n\n女の子 is a casual word for young girls, like kids or teenagers. Sometimes it can also refer to adult women, but only to playfully or affectionately highlight their youthful or girlish qualities.",
  "primaryReading": "おんなのこ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since there's hiragana in here, you can bet that these kanji will use the kun'yomi readings. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 女. You might even remember the one for 子, but here's a mnemonic just in case:\n\nWhen you need to remember the kun'yomi reading for 子, just think about how a child stole your <reading>co</reading>at (こ). You gave it to her because she looked cold, but then she ran off down the street and left you shouting, \"Coat! Coat! That 子 has my coat!\"",
