  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>woman</kanji> <kanji>child</kanji> is a <vocabulary>girl</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word has two kanji with hiragana stuck in the middle. That hiragana is the particle の. This time, it just means the noun before の is modifying the noun after it.\n\n女の子 is a casual word for young girls, like kids or teenagers. Sometimes it can also refer to adult women, but only to playfully or affectionately highlight their youthful or girlish qualities.",
  "primaryReading": "おんなのこ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since there's hiragana in here, you can bet that these kanji will use the kun'yomi readings. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <vocabulary>女</vocabulary>. The only thing I have to make sure that you know is 子. When you need to remember the kun'yomi reading of 子, just think about you fighting a child (you're a jerk, apparently!). When you hit her in the face, she flies to the floor, and the ref calls out \"<reading>KO</reading>!\" because you just knocked the poor kid out.",
