  "meaningMnemonic": "I bet you remember <ja>集める</ja> means \"to collect something.\" But this time you're not collecting something. Instead, something just… collects. In other words, <ja>集まる</ja> means <vocabulary>to come together</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to gather</vocabulary>. Friends come together, or fans gather at a venue — that sort of thing. No direct object needed, since this is intransitive.\n\nVerbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive like this. You can remember this because if something is <ja>ある</ja>, it's just there, existing, not acting <em>on</em> anything else. That's why verbs that sound like it are often intransitive too!",
