Someday he'll be the 王, if he's lucky, but right now he's just the king's child, a.k.a. the prince!\n\nIf you prefer some grammatical details, you can try to remember that when a word consists of two kanji, sometimes the first kanji has a possessive relation to the second. In this case, 王 possesses 子, making it the king's child. Historically, male children had priority in royal succession, so I guess that's why this word means \"prince.\"",
  "primaryReading": "おうじ",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Also take note that the reading for 子 (し) is changed to じ.\n\nThat said, this reading can be easy to confuse with other similar words, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nThe <vocabulary>prince</vocabulary> is always saying \"<reading>Ohh</reading>, <reading>Je</reading>sus (おうじ), please let me be king!\" In fact, the prince probably says \"Ohh, Jesus\" to ask for help at least once a day.
