  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>stream</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>to stream</vocabulary> (though it's also <vocabulary>to flow</vocabulary>, a very similar word). You can differentiate this from 流す because with 流す you flush something down the toilet, which causes it to overflow so you <reading>sue</reading> (す) the toilet maker. With 流れる you find a <reading>rare</reading> (れる) jewel trying to flow down the river. You grab it, and see it's a rare diamond!",
  "primaryReading": "ながれる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 流す. So long as you know that you should be able to read this one as well!",
