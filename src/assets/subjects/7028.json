  "readingMnemonic": "To remember the reading, think about how the <vocabulary>Japanese Emperor</vocabulary>, can always pull out his \"<reading>me card</reading>\" (みかど) when he's in trouble. It's kind of like how a \"trump card\" is the one that's above all the others, but with the emperor he's always up there, so it's a \"me card\" to him. And who's gonna argue with the emperor? Not me.",
