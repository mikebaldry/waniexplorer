  "primaryMeaning": "To Separate",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>detach</kanji>, but what happens when something detaches? It causes it <vocabulary>to separate</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to leave</vocabulary>. This refers to when something separates on its own. You aren't doing the separating. You know this because it's <reading>rare</reading> (れる) to see things separate, but sometimes you do see them. Also, whenever you see れる usually it's a safe bet that you're not the one doing the action, right? Think about it.",
  "primaryReading": "はなれる",
  "readingMnemonic": "For the reading, think about what is separating. It's quite sad, because all of the <reading>花</reading>s (はな) are separating from their stems and falling on the ground, and nobody knows why. Just falling off and being sad.",
