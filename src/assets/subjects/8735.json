  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>woman</kanji> <kanji>person</kanji> is a <vocabulary>woman</vocabulary>.\n\nThe の particle here means the first noun is modifying the second one, so you can probably see why 女の人 (a woman person) really just means woman! It's more polite than saying 女 by itself, so that's all you have to remember. ",
  "primaryReading": "おんなのひと",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 1 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.",
