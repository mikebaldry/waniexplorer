  "primaryReading": "こころよい",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word's reading is pretty weird. We're going to think back to a couple different words to put this one together. The word for heart (心), is こころ. The word for good is よい (or いい, but for this word's sake, よい). A \"good heart (feeling)\" is one where your heart feels nice and warm and fuzzy (figuratively, not literally. If it's literal, go to the hospital please). That is a <vocabulary>pleasant</vocabulary> feeling. A こころよい feeling.",
