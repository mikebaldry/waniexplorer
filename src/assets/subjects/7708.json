  "primaryMeaning": "End Of A Line",
  "meaningMnemonic": "You have 最, which means <kanji>most</kanji>, and 後尾, which means something like \"back\" or \"rear\" (<kanji>behind</kanji> + <kanji>tail</kanji>). When you're at the most back part of something, you might find yourself at the <vocabulary>end of a line</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>end of a queue</vocabulary>.\n\n最後尾 is often seen on signs at the end of a long line to help people locate where to join the queue.",
  "primaryReading": "さいこうび",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. Be careful, because this is 最 + 後尾, and not 最後 + 尾, meaning that 後 is read こう, not ご! ",
