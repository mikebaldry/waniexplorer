  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is unlike the kanji reading, so let's use a separate mnemonic to remember this. Just imagine yourself going <vocabulary>to sit</vocabulary> down. You sit down, and the ground collapses below you and you fall. When you land, you find yourself in a nasty, stinking <reading>sewer</reading> (すわ). It is so gross. Taste the sewage in your mouth. Smell it. Feel gross. You shouldn't have sat down on that spot, it was looking awfully dangerous, now that you think about it.",
