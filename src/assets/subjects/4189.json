  "primaryMeaning": "To Put On Shoes",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>footwear</kanji>. And what do you do with footwear, usually? You put it on! That's why this word is <vocabulary>to put on shoes</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put on pants</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put on a skirt</vocabulary>.\n\nOkay, pants and skirts aren't exactly footwear. But 履く is basically used for any garment you wear from the waist down, including socks, shoes, boots, pants, skirts, shorts, and even underpants.",
  "primaryReading": "はく",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou decide <vocabulary>to put on shoes</vocabulary>, and then <vocabulary>to put on pants</vocabulary>. \"<reading>Ha</reading>hahaha!\" (は) you laugh. What a ridiculous idea to put on shoes <em>before</em> you put on pants! But you do it every morning, and every morning it makes you laugh. You really crack yourself up. ",
