  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is an exceptional one. 豆 is okay, and is the on'yomi reading from the kanji. The 納 part is weird though. Instead of being のう it's なっ. But, if you can remember the meaning of this word, you can just think about how you do <reading>not</reading> (なっとう) want to eat <vocabulary>natto</vocabulary>. At least a lot of people don't want to eat it. It's quite the acquired taste.",
