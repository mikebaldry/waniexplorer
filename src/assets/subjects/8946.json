  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>finish</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to finish something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to end something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning you finish something, like a long day at work!\n\nYou need to differentiate this from 終わる, which is when something just ends on its own. 終える is about when you make something end. Remember it like this: Canadians always end their sentences with \"eh\" え, right? Well that's how you know they're ending their sentence. Just listen for the \"eh,\" eh?",
  "primaryReading": "おえる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou finally finished your school project. <reading>\"Oh, A!\"</reading> (おえ) you say to yourself, as though you can grade your own project. ",
