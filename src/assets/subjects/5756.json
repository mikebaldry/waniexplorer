  "primaryMeaning": "Rice Bowl",
  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nTo be exact, 丼 refers to a chinaware bowl that's bigger and sturdier than your ordinary rice bowl. It's often used for one-bowl dishes like katsudon, gyūdon, poke, but also noodle soups like ramen!",
  "primaryReading": "どんぶり",
  "readingMnemonic": "You learned the どん reading for this kanji. This reading is just an extension of that, coming out to どんぶり. You can remember the ぶり part because you know what your favorite rice bowl is... it's a <reading>brie</reading> (ぶり) cheese rice bowl. Slightly unorthodox, but quite delicious!",
