This can also mean <kanji>occupy</kanji>, maybe because learning your fortune shows you how you're going to occupy your life. Or how it will occupy you…\n\nYou haven't seen the radical in a while, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember the kanji: Put your toe in your mouth to learn your <kanji>fortune</kanji>. The taste will tell you everything you need to know about your fortune. But your toe has to <kanji>occupy</kanji> your mouth first for it to work.",

Your fortune is that you’ll have an encounter with a <reading>cen</reading>taur (せん) in the near future. Just then you realize that the fortune teller is actually a centaur! The fortune has come true!",
