  "primaryMeaning": "To Pull Something Out",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>pull out</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to pull something out</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word often implies that the pulling out requires force or effort. It's a pretty versatile word, and can also cover things like letting the air out of something, draining the water out of something, and even overtaking someone or pulling through difficulties.",
  "primaryReading": "ぬく",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Just go ahead and extract it out of your memory so you can use it here.",
