  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji. But there's a second reading you haven't learned yet, so here's a mnemonic for both:\n\nWhat do you do in your <vocabulary>house</vocabulary>? You <reading>ea</reading>t <reading>e</reading>ggs (いえ). You love to eat eggs at <vocabulary>home</vocabulary>. But it has to be on the 内 (うち), a.k.a. the inside, of your house. For some reason you can only eat eggs in the 内 of your house.\n\nBoth readings relate to house and home, but いえ is a bit more for the physical building (the house) while うち is more for your personal sense of home, including your family and household.",
