When you're doing lots of living, days and seasons just seem <vocabulary>to end</vocabulary> rather quickly like that.\n\nAlternatively, think about how <reading>rare</reading> (れる) it is <vocabulary>to get dark</vocabulary>. It really only happens once every 24 hours. A pretty rare occurence if you ask me.",
