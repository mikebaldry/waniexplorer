  "primaryMeaning": "To Bend Down",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>yield</kanji>, and 屈む means <vocabulary>to bend down</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to crouch</vocabulary>. After all, bending down and crouching are sort of like yielding to gravity, don’t you think?\n\n屈む refers to the act of lowering your head or body, so it can also mean <vocabulary>to duck</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to squat</vocabulary> depending on the context.",
  "primaryReading": "かがむ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou always have <vocabulary>to bend down</vocabulary> to get into your <reading>car ga</reading>rage (かが) because you’re just too tall. You have <vocabulary>to crouch</vocabulary> just to get inside your car garage! Let’s hope you can find a bigger one someday. ",
