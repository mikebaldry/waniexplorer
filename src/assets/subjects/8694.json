Think about big energies you feel in the atmosphere: thunderstorms, tornadoes, the aurora borealis. Just remember, this is the atmosphere in the sky, not the atmosphere in a fancy restaurant.",
  "primaryReading": "たいき",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nImagine an <vocabulary>atmosphere</vocabulary> consisting entirely of <reading>tie</reading>s and <reading>key</reading>s (たいき), floating around. The ties are getting tangled together, and the keys keep bashing you on the head. Bring back the normal atmosphere, this one's horrible.",
