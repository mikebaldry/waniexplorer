  "primaryMeaning": "To Eat",
  "meaningMnemonic": "You know the kanji means <kanji>eat</kanji>, and you also already know 食べる. So what's the deal with this also meaning <vocabulary>to eat</vocabulary>? \n\n食う carries a more masculine and coarse tone than 食べる, so it can come off as rough or impolite in certain situations. It also has a wider set of usages, for example in saying that something is eating up time or resources, or saying that you were bitten by a bug. You'll come across more of these, but they're all pretty straightforward, so don't worry!",
  "primaryReading": "くう",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You do know that reading, but this uses a different one, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThere's nothing you love <vocabulary>to eat</vocabulary> more than <reading>coo</reading>kies (く). You could eat them day and night, but watch out, as that might get a little… time-consuming.",
