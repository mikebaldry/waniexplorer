  "meaningMnemonic": "You know this is a verb because it ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound. The kanji for this word is <kanji>right</kanji> or <kanji>success</kanji>, so what's the verb form of that? Turns out it's a ton of things. But it's mostly for when things go right. As in <vocabulary>to be right</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be on target</vocabulary>. \n\n<ja>当たる</ja> is intransitive, so it doesn't take a direct object. Your answer is right, or your shot is on target. See? No direct object.",
  "primaryReading": "あたる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the あ portion. \n\nWhen your guess turns out <vocabulary>to be right</vocabulary>, you can't help but shout, \"<reading>Ah</reading>! (あ)\" That \"Ah\" is your victory cry.",
