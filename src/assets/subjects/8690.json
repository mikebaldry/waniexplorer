  "meaningMnemonic": "Something that can <kanji>abstain</kanji> until it's needed makes for good <vocabulary>backup</vocabulary>. Think about it — you don't want backup rushing in too early, right? It should abstain until the backup is actually needed.\n\nNote that 控え isn't used for spares and extras. It's more for necessary backups, like a backup player in sports, a document <vocabulary>copy</vocabulary> for record keeping, or a <vocabulary>receipt stub</vocabulary>.",
