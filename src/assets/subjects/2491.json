  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>above</kanji>, and this verb means <vocabulary>to go up</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to rise</vocabulary>.\n\nIt's an intransitive verb, so it doesn't take a direct object. For example: Prices go up. Temperatures rise. See? No direct object. You can remember this because stock prices always seems to go up when you see this one girl (がる). You don't know how this girl makes stock prices go up, she just does. Think of her as your lucky girl.",
  "primaryReading": "あがる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading. You've learned that reading, but here's a mnemonic in case you need a refresher:\n\nYou know this word means <vocabulary>to go up</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to rise</vocabulary>. Imagine just rising into the air, sort of floating up all of a sudden. What would you say? You'd probably scream \"<ja><reading>Ah</reading></ja>!\" (あ) the moment you started to go up. You know, out of surprise. Going up? Ah!",
