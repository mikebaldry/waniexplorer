It was the <vocabulary>head of household</vocabulary>. This head of household probably told servants what to do and was all bossy and stuff. He was the master person. \n\nAlso, this often means <vocabulary>husband</vocabulary>. Because, I guess the head of household back in the day was the husband. Those sexist ancient people!",
  "primaryReading": "しゅじん",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nIn Japan, tradition says the <vocabulary>head of a household</vocabulary> must slide down a <reading>chu</reading>te in only <reading>jean</reading>s (しゅじん). Whenever you need to speak to the head of the household, they'll come sliding down a chute wearing nothing but jeans. What a sight!",
