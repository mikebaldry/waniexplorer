  "primaryMeaning": "To Get Baked",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 焼く is \"to bake,\" \"to burn something,\" or \"to grill\"? 焼ける is just the intransitive version. That means no direct object needed! So this verb means <vocabulary>to get baked</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to get burned</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to get grilled</vocabulary>. \n\n焼ける is used when something is heated and transformed by the heat. Depending on the context, it can refer to anything from a muffin getting baked, fish being grilled, or pottery being fired. You can even use it when your skin gets a tan or a house burns down. Well, that last one is kinda sad. I hope it never happens.\n\nYou can distinguish 焼ける from 焼く because when cooking, you always <reading>care</reading> (ける) to ensure the food gets baked or grilled really well. You want to make sure it's properly 焼ける'd (heated through) to be safe!",
