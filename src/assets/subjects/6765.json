  "primaryMeaning": "To Be In A Hurry",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a bit of a weird word. The kanji is <kanji>char</kanji>, and a previous word you learned (焦げる) is \"to be burned.\" This, on the other hand, is \"to be in a hurry\" or \"to be impatient.\" I guess if you're getting burned or have that feeling, you're going <vocabulary>to be in a hurry</vocabulary> and you're going <vocabulary>to be impatient</vocabulary>. You can tell that this is that word because it only has one kana, る, which stands for <reading>ru</reading>de. You're feeling someone is being rude (or maybe you are), which is why you have this feeling of impatience and hurrying.",
  "primaryReading": "あせる",
  "readingMnemonic": "You're being rude, but you're also being a big <reading>ass</reading> (あせ) with your impatience.",
