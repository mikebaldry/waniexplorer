  "primaryMeaning": "To Give",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>give</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to give</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to grant</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a relatively formal word that is generally used in writing. In conversations, people commonly use more relaxed words like あげる or くれる.",
  "primaryReading": "あたえる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou go <vocabulary>to give</vocabulary> a bone to your dog. <reading>Atta</reading> (あた) boy, Sparky! <reading>Atta</reading> boy.",
