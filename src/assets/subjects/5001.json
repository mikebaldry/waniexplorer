  "primaryMeaning": "To Come Out",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 抜く means \"to pull something out\"? 抜ける describes something coming out of where it was, so it means <vocabulary>to come out</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to fall out</vocabulary>. \n\nThis can be used for air coming out of a balloon, hair falling out, or pages missing from a book. It also means passing through places or leaving a group you were a part of.\n\nTo distinguish this word from 抜く, imagine a bunch of <reading>kale</reading> (ける) coming out of the ground on its own! Nobody pulled it out, it just came out by itself.",
  "primaryReading": "ぬける",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Also, it is the same as 抜く.",
