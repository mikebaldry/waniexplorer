  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>guess</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to guess</vocabulary>. Alternatively, you can learn this as <vocabulary>to sense</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to presume</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "さっする",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this is actually the same as what you learned with the kanji, but the さつ is shortened to さっ. If you had <vocabulary>to guess</vocabulary> be sure to guess with the shorter つ.",
