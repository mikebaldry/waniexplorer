The water from the tsunami continues to drip from your mohawk long after the tsunami has passed. There’s a lot of water in your hair now, so it’s probably going to drip for a while.",

This techie device of yours is like a hair dryer helmet. You put it over your mohawk, it does its thing, and your hair is dry! Being a techie sure does have its benefits.",
