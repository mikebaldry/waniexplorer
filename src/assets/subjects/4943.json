  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 河 makes sense. The reading for 童 however is weird. Since the meaning is \"kappa\" though you can use that to remember the reading as well. If you don't know what a kappa is do some research on the internets and figure out about them. It's interesting, and it will help you to remember this word.",
