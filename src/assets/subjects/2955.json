  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a strange one, but only at first glance. You <kanji>make</kanji> a <kanji>house</kanji>. You'd think this would mean something like \"building a house\" or \"construction\" or something. Instead, it means writer. Think of it this way: A <vocabulary>writer</vocabulary> <kanji>makes</kanji> (writes and creates works) in their <kanji>home</kanji>. Writers don't make their word magic in a corporate office!\n\n作家 is generally used to refer to someone who writes professionally as an occupation, especially in the field of literature. It can also be used more broadly to refer to a creator who produces individual works of art or craft.",
  "primaryReading": "さっか",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since the さく reading of 作 becomes さっ here, we've made a mnemonic for you to remember this reading:\n\n<vocabulary>Writer</vocabulary>s love <reading>soccer</reading> (さっか). In fact, playing soccer is how they get their inspiration. Try playing some soccer, maybe you'll become a <vocabulary>creator</vocabulary> too!",
