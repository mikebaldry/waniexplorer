You can call someone 綺麗. You can also mention how clean something is with 綺麗. Gives you some insight as to what \"beauty\" is in Japan, I suppose. Take your baths, folks.\n\nWondering what the difference is between 綺麗 and 美しい? 美しい is more dramatic, so it implies you’re really blown away by something’s (or someone’s) beauty. 綺麗, on the other hand, is a more everyday word that covers anything that’s beautiful, pretty, or even just clean. In other words, the bar is a bit lower for 綺麗!",
