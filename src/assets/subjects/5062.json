  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The ぱ at the end is the only tricky part here since that isn't a common reading (or the one you learned before) for the kanji. Just think of your ol' <reading>Pa</reading> (ぱ), who is the biggest half-asser you know.\n",
