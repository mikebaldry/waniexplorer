  "primaryMeaning": "To Beckon",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>beckon</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to beckon</vocabulary>. \n\nSince 招く conjures up the image of someone beckoning, it also means <vocabulary>to invite</vocabulary>, and is a relatively formal word. Figuratively, it can also mean <vocabulary>to cause</vocabulary>, as in inviting some undesirable outcome or situation.",
  "primaryReading": "まねく",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You move <vocabulary>to beckon</vocabulary> your friend over. You can't see him well, so that's why you invite him to come closer. He is hiding something, and it turns out to be his long, luxurious horse <reading>mane</reading> (まね). Why does he have a mane!? Horse steroids?",
