  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nNote that 否  ( いな ) is very formal and somewhat archaic. Today, it's most commonly used in the expression  〜か否か  (whether… or <vocabulary>not</vocabulary>).",
  "primaryReading": "いな",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nInstead of saying \"no\" you say \"na,\" and instead of saying \"na\" you say <reading>いな</reading>. \n\nNote that 否 can also be read いや, which is a common way to say “no” in modern Japanese, but that reading is almost always written in kana.",
