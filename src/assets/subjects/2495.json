  "primaryMeaning": "To Lower Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>below</kanji> so the verb version of that is when you put something below you. It's <vocabulary>to lower something</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to hang something</vocabulary>, such as a lamp from the ceiling.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, which means that the verb is done by one entity onto another. In other words, you lower <i>something</i>. Like your impossibly high expectations for yourself. Take it easy!",
  "primaryReading": "さげる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou want <vocabulary>to lower something</vocabulary>. In this case, it's a tree, so you need a <reading>saw</reading> (さ). Lower the tree to the ground gently while you slowly saw it down!",
