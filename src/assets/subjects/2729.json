  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>hit</kanji> so the vocab is <vocabulary>to hit something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to strike something</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to type</vocabulary>.\n\nYou can use this word to describe bumping a part of your body on something, hitting a ball or a nail, or typing on a keyboard. It can also describe hitting a person, but that use is less common and sounds a bit literary.",
  "primaryReading": "うつ",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you haven't learned yet, but never fear! A mnemonic is here:\n\nIf you’re planning <vocabulary>to hit</vocabulary> an <reading>u</reading>ni (う), you’re going to need a special bat or hammer. I don’t know why you’d want to hit a sea urchin, but make sure you have the right equipment if you do, because those things are spiky!",
