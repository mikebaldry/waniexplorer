  "meaningMnemonic": "So this doesn't really make much sense in terms of the kanji and word, but it is what it is. Let's remember it this way:\n\nThe kanji is <kanji>fruit</kanji> so the meaning is <vocabulary>really</vocabulary>? Like, really really? Because it sounds like you made that up. I really doubt it means really.\n\nIt can also mean <vocabulary>as was expected</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>just as I thought</vocabulary>, but usually we use it as a way to say, \"Really? I don't really believe you...\"",
  "primaryReading": "はたして",
  "readingMnemonic": "To remember the reading, just imagine yourself snorting out a sharp \"<reading>HA</reading>!\" (は) right before saying the phrase: \"<reading>HA!</reading> Just as I thought.\"",
