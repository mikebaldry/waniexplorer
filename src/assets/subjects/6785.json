  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. But it also has a secondary reading you haven't learned, so here’s a mnemonic for it:\n\n<vocabulary>Blade</vocabulary> in hand, you charge at your foes hollering \"<reading>Yah</reading>! <reading>Eee</reading>! <reading>Baa</reading>!\" (やいば). As the blade cuts through them, you cry \"Yah! Eee! Baa!\" even louder. This battle cry always fuels your fury and doubles the force of your swinging blade. \"Yah! Eee! Baa!\"\n\nWhile both readings relate to blades, they have slightly different uses. は is used for any cutting tool's blade or edge, whereas やいば is a little old-fashioned and specifically refers to the blades of swords or knives, often in literary contexts.",
