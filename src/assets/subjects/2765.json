  "primaryMeaning": "To Think About",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>think</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to think about</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to consider</vocabulary>. \n\nNote that this isn't the \"to think\" that is like \"I think that he is a power ranger.\" No, this is more like the actual thinking action. That's why this word is \"to think about\" or \"to consider\" rather than plain old \"to think\" which is 思う.",
  "primaryReading": "かんがえる",
  "readingMnemonic": "If you want <vocabulary>to think</vocabulary>, the best way to do so is to do the <reading>conga</reading> (かんが). Imagine yourself doing the conga and thinking away. You're so inspired! The thoughts are flowing as freely as your sweet, slow dance moves.",
