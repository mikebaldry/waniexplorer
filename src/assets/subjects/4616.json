  "meaningMnemonic": "When you <kanji>divide</kanji> something into parts and <kanji>join</kanji> them back together, you are better able to evaluate the <vocabulary>ratio</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>percentage</vocabulary> of these parts in relation to the whole. Think of all these parts, neatly separated and then placed next to one another. It's only because you divided them that you get to see them this way.\n\n割合 usually refers to the ratio of a certain part when compared to the whole, often expressed as a percentage. When used this way it's similar to 比率, but 割合 is more common in everyday language.\n\nNote that 割合 can also be used as an adverb, where it means <vocabulary>comparatively</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>fairly</vocabulary>.",
