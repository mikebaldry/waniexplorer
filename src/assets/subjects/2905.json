  "meaningMnemonic": "If you think about <kanji>direct</kanji> <kanji>go</kanji>ing (aka transportation) how would you make it better? You'd make it so everything was <vocabulary>nonstop</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>direct</vocabulary>. Just imagine how much nicer it would be if every airplane you took was direct and you never had to stop. So nice!\n\nNote 直行 is commonly used in business settings to describe traveling directly to a destination without making any stops, like visiting a client’s office straight from your home.",
  "primaryReading": "ちょっこう",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word and uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. The ちょく of 直 is shortened with a small っ, though, so make sure to take note of that.",
