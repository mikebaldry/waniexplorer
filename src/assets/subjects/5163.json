  "meaningMnemonic": "You don't say \"to aggression.\" When you do aggression on someone, you're probably doing something to hurt them in some way. This is an attack, making this word <vocabulary>to attack</vocabulary>.\n\n攻める means to attack or advance on an enemy in battle, but it can also apply to making a strong or proactive move in competitions like sports, business, or games. It can also be used to describe taking bold actions, like moving ahead with a risky plan.",
  "primaryReading": "せめる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\n<vocabulary>To attack</vocabulary> someone, use a <reading>ce</reading>lery (せ) stick. Celery is not a deadly weapon but most people hate it, so it's perfect to casually attack someone, especially those who hate celery.",
