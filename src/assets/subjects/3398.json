  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWho has <vocabulary>short</vocabulary> hair and always wears shorts? It's <reading>Ms. Ca</reading>rr (みじか)! Everyone always recognizes Ms. Carr because she's the one with the short hair and shorts, no matter the weather. Ms. Carr, the ultimate short style icon!",
