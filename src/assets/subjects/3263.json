I mean, you've never thought about it, but do you really need more knees? <vocabulary>Not really</vocabulary>...\n\nIn this first meaning, 別に is often used on its own, or with a negative verb or adjective, as in 別に長くない (not particularly long).\n\nHowever, when 別に is used with a positive verb, it often simply means <vocabulary>separately</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>in addition to</vocabulary>. After all, when you have to do something separately, you have to do it in addition to something else. Like learning this meaning in addition to the first one. What a chore!",
