  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>hoist</kanji>. But most commonly (and most importantly), this word means <vocabulary>to deep fry</vocabulary>. I guess you can think of it as hoisting that delicious deep-fried food out of the oil.\n\nOf course, 揚げる can also mean <vocabulary>to hoist</vocabulary> (a sail) or <vocabulary>to raise</vocabulary> (a flag) depending on the context.",
  "primaryReading": "あげる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Remember the other \"to raise\" vocabs? They are all あげる as well. For example, 上げる is あげる and 挙げる is あげる as well.",
