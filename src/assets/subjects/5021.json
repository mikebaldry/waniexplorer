  "primaryMeaning": "To Worry",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>worry</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to worry</vocabulary>.\n\n悩む is often intransitive, like 彼はいつも悩んでいる (he's always worrying). But it can also be transitive, in which case it'll take a direct object, like 彼女のことを悩む (to worry about her). ",
  "primaryReading": "なやむ",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji, so no need <vocabulary>to worry</vocabulary> about it.",
