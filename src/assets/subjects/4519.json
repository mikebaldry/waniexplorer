  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\n価 refers to the monetary value or the price of goods in a transaction. Although it's somewhat old-fashioned and less common these days, you may still see it used in advanced phrases like 価をつける (to set a price) or 一文の価もない (not even worth a penny).\n\nNote that あたい can also refer to a numerical value in mathematics, such as the value a variable or function takes, but it's more commonly written with the kanji 値 in this use.",
  "primaryReading": "あたい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Okay, this is a great <vocabulary>value</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>price</vocabulary>. Wait, what is? <reading>A tie</reading> (あたい). Get a tie, and it will make you more professional which will help you to get a better job. Great value, right there, just for a tie.",
