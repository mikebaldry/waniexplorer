  "meaningMnemonic": "You know how 非常 means <kanji>emergency</kanji> and how 口 can be some kind of doorway (like in 入り口, for example)? Well, if that's the case, then you have an emergency doorway. Usually you run away from emergencies, though, making this an <vocabulary>emergency exit</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "ひじょうぐち",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the words 非常 and 口 combined together. The thing that makes this weird is that it's a mix of the kun and on'yomi readings. I guess things get all jostled up when you have yourself an emergency.",
