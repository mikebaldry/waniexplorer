  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>tall</kanji> or <kanji>expensive</kanji>? It's the same: <vocabulary>tall</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>expensive</vocabulary>. \n\nWeird that this word means both of these things, yeah? Just imagine money piled up to be really tall. That money is tall because it needs to buy something expensive.",
  "primaryReading": "たかい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nBeing <vocabulary>tall</vocabulary> is really <vocabulary>expensive</vocabulary> because you have to buy a <reading>ta</reading>ll <reading>car</reading> (たか). If it's not a tall car then your tall body won't fit inside, and those tall cars are expensive!",
