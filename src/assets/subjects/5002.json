  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji itself means <kanji>catch</kanji>, and 捕える means <vocabulary>to capture something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to catch something</vocabulary>. \n\n<ja>捕える</ja> is often used in writing to describe having someone captured to keep them from escaping. But it can also be used in more abstract contexts, like capturing a moment in a photograph, grasping a concept or idea, or seizing an opportunity.\n\nYou can remember the meaning for this because everyone wants to capture <reading>el</reading>ves (える). Sorry, elves… You're just so cool, people want to capture and keep you forever.",
  "primaryReading": "とらえる",
  "readingMnemonic": "You recently learned 捕まる, which uses the same kanji, but this word has a totally different reading. To remember it, just think about how the meaning of 捕える kind of resembles the verb 捉える that you learned a while ago. 捕える is mostly for capturing things, and 捉える is mostly for grasping ideas. So it kinda makes sense that they'd have the same とらえる reading, right?",
