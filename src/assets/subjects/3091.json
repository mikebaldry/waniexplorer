  "primaryMeaning": "To Receive Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>receive</kanji>, and this verb means just about the same thing: <vocabulary>to receive something</vocabulary>!\n\nThis is a transitive verb, so it takes a direct object. But 受ける often implies passive reception, generally of intangible objects like an education, or damage. It can also mean <vocabulary>to take something</vocabulary>, like taking an exam or a job offer.",
  "primaryReading": "うける",
  "readingMnemonic": "There’s a creature in front of you that’s about <vocabulary>to receive something</vocabulary>, but what is it? It’s an <reading>u</reading>ni (う), and it’s going to receive a warm welcome and an education. Picture the sea urchin receiving these things, and then going on to take an exam to prove how much education it’s received.",
