It could be his own house on fire, and the gambler would still use the free heat source to get some baking done. Maybe he's gambling that those baked goods will offset the cost of a new home…\n\nThis kanji also means <kanji>burn</kanji>, because that's what happens when you expose something to a lot of heat.",
  "readingMnemonic": "He used to <kanji>bake</kanji> for the <reading>Ya</reading>nkees (や). Baseball cakes, bat baguettes, that kind of thing. A career-ending kitchen injury forced him to retire. That's when he developed a gambling problem. But he still likes to bake whenever the Yankees are on TV.",
