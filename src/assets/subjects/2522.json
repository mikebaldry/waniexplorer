  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 月 has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the がつ reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\n<vocabulary>May</vocabulary> is when you and your buddies get together to eat <reading>Go</reading>dzilla <reading>guts</reading> (ごがつ). You go hunting for Godzilla just for his delicious guts, and then eat them with your friends. Yummy.",
