So if you know the reading of that word (I hope you do!) then you can apply that knowledge here.\n\nJust a quick side note — 開く can also be read as ひらく, but we're going to focus on the あく reading here. Since ひらく has slightly different meanings, we won't accept it as a reading for this word, so be sure to enter あく!\n",
