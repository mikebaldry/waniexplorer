  "meaningMnemonic": "To <radical>construct</radical> a whole <radical>ceremony</radical>, you can’t just make it up on the spot. That is not a ceremony. A ceremony has a past. A ceremony is done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a <kanji>ritual</kanji> first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish <kanji>ceremony</kanji>.\n\nThis kanji also means <kanji>equation</kanji> for some reason. Just think of a ceremony that involves doing math and coming up with equations. How strange would that be? Pretend you're at this ceremony.",
  "readingMnemonic": "So, you're at a <kanji>ritual</kanji>, but not just any old ritual. This is a full-blown <kanji>ceremony</kanji> and it's incredibly <reading>chic</reading> (しき). Imagine just how chic it is. Give it a shot – I'll let you come up with the chicness this time (it's good practice).",
