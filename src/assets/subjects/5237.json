  "meaningMnemonic": "<kanji>One</kanji> <kanji>cup of liquid</kanji> is equal to <vocabulary>one cup</vocabulary>. It could just be <vocabulary>a drink</vocabulary>, but if you're measuring exactly one cup, it needs to be <vocabulary>full</vocabulary> to the brim. That's <vocabulary>a lot</vocabulary> of liquid—so be careful not to spill!\n\n一杯 mainly refers to the amount that fills a container, like a cup, glass, bowl, or even spoon. It can also describe something being \"full,\" such as a full stomach or a theater at capacity (like how a cup is filled to the brim!). Depending on the context, it can also mean \"a lot,\" as fullness implies abundance. When it uses that meaning, you'll also often see it written in just kana (いっぱい).",
  "primaryReading": "いっぱい",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just remember that 一 becomes いっ, and 杯 becomes ぱい.",
