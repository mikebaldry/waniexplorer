  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>task</kanji> so what's the verb vocab version? Well, when you do a task, you are going <vocabulary>to work as</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to serve as</vocabulary> something to do that task.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\n<vocabulary>To work as</vocabulary> my secretary, you will have to complete a task. A task where you bring me <reading>two toe</reading>s (つと)! Don't ask me why! You want <vocabulary>to serve as</vocabulary> my assistant, right? Just get me those two toes then!",
