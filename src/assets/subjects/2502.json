That's why this combination of kanji means <vocabulary>adult</vocabulary>, and when used like an adjective, it means <vocabulary>mature</vocabulary>.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Sometimes kanji have exceptional readings that are neither on’yomi, nor kun’yomi, and this is one of them. So here’s a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\n\n\"I'm an <vocabulary>adult</vocabulary>, which means I have adult responsibilities, like… <reading>oh, toner</reading> (おとな)!\" Are you an adult with your own toner printer? Ohhhh, toner…",
