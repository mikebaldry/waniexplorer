  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Diluted",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>dilute</kanji>, and this is an intransitive verb, as you can guess from the まる ending. So this verb means <vocabulary>to be diluted</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be diminished</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to become weak</vocabulary>. ",
  "primaryReading": "うすまる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\n\nThe reading comes from 薄い, so if you know that you'll be able to read this too. If not, here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou don't want your drink <vocabulary>to be diluted</vocabulary>, so <reading>you sue</reading> (うす) anyone who dares pour you a weak drink.",
