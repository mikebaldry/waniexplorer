This is the best way to pierce a member of the shellfish family, I promise.\n\nThis kanji also has a second meaning. That shellfish you pierced with the window is in two halves now. You can use those halves as plates for sushi. If you count the broken shells you'll know how much sushi you have. That makes them <kanji>sushi counter</kanji>s!",
