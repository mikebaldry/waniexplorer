  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn that reading for 井, so we've got a mnemonic to help you out with that. Just note that the on'yomi for 井 isn't actually じょう, but rather しょう, it just ends up getting rendaku'd here!\n\nFixing up <vocabulary>ceilings</vocabulary> is a tricky task, but you've got just the man for it: <reading>Joe</reading> (じょう). Your local farmhand that does it all, nothing is too tricky or out of reach for him, you're starting to think that this man can do just about anything. What a handy person to have around.",
