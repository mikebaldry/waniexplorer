  "primaryMeaning": "To Give Birth",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means \"life\" so what is the verb form of that? Would it be \"to do life\"? No, probably not. In this case it is <vocabulary>to give birth</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to produce</vocabulary>.\n\nYou'll have to differentiate this one from the word 生まれる as well. You can remember that this one means \"to give birth\" because when you compare, the act of giving birth probably feels shorter than the act of being birthed, at least in terms of sheer terror. The pain of giving birth will make it feel quick, when you look back on it... but just imagine how traumatized the baby must be from going through that as well. So, the act of giving birth is shorter, just like the word itself!",
  "primaryReading": "うむ",
  "readingMnemonic": "You have to remember the う part of this word to be able to read it. It's the same as 生まれる, so that could help if you've learned that word already. If not, just imagine yourself giving birth, but not to a baby. Instead, it's an <reading>u</reading>ni (う) you're delivering. Luckily, uni aren't fully formed with their spikes at birth so it shouldn't be a problem. Ooof! What a relief!",
