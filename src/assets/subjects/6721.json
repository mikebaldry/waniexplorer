  "readingMnemonic": "You really don’t want your knee <vocabulary>to be grazed</vocabulary>. If it happens, you are gonna <reading>sue</reading> (す). But the <reading>cos</reading>t (こす) of suing is pretty high, so be careful not to get grazed in the first place!\n\nDepending on which reading you use, the nuance changes slightly. For example, すれる is the usual choice when you’re talking about your grazed knees or worn out jeans. For other uses, they are often interchangeable.",
