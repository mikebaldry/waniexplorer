You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou decide <vocabulary>to neglect</vocabulary> everything. Your school, your family, even your own <reading>name</reading> (なま). You've managed <vocabulary>to slack</vocabulary> for so long that you can't even remember your name? That's pretty impressive, actually.",
