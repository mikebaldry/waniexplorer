  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>ascend</kanji> so the verb vocab version must be <vocabulary>to ascend</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to rise</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "のぼる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but it's pretty easy. How do you read all the other \"to climb\" words? 登る is one example. 上る is another. They're all <reading>のぼ</reading>る, and so is this. Unlike the other climbing words, though, this suggests there's no effort involved. That's why you're \"ascending\" and not climbing, because climbing is a bit of work.",
