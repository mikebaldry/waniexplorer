  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned the verbs 放す and 放れる but this one is a little different. This is a specific kind of releasing. It means <vocabulary>to fire</vocabulary> an arrow, <vocabulary>to hit</vocabulary> a baseball, or <vocabulary>to emit</vocabulary> light. It even works when you're releasing a fart. Yes, it means <vocabulary>to break wind</vocabulary> too. What a great word!",
