  "primaryReading": "あいだ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. 間 has two common kun'yomi readings, あいだ and ま. You haven't learned these readings yet, so here's an explanation of each reading and mnemonics to help you remember them: \n\nWhen 間 refers to a longer interval of time, it's generally read as あいだ. For a short burst of time, it's read as ま. When it means an interval of space, it's usually read as あいだ. \n\nYou can remember this because time feels longer in <reading>Ida</reading>ho (あいだ). Any interval of time you spend there feels so long, because Idaho life moves so slowly. As soon as you cross the border and enter a new state, you call your <reading>ma</reading> (ま) to tell her you're finally out of that slooooow state, and the intervals of time feel shorter. ",
