So this means <vocabulary>someone else</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>other people</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is more general than 他人, which you already learned. 他の人 can be anyone that's not the speaker, or not the person being talked about. 他人, on the other hand, has an added implication that the person is someone unknown or unrelated.",
