  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji, but 何 actually uses the kun'yomi reading here! And since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\n\n<vocabulary>How many days</vocabulary> does it take you to bake a <reading>naan</reading> <reading>Nietzsche</reading> (なんにち)? It's not easy to make a Nietzsche entirely out of naan, so I wonder how many days it would take.",
