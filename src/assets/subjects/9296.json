  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi readings. You've learned this reading for 相, but not for 次. Instead of giving you a mnemonic, we think it's easier to remember that 次ぐ being read つぐ comes from the 次 reading つぎ. Not too hard! All in all, that makes this あいつぐ.",
