  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\nAs a vocab word on its own, 事 usually refers to an intangible or abstract <vocabulary>thing</vocabulary>, like いい事 (good thing) or する事 (things to do). \n\nDepending on the context, it can also mean <vocabulary>matter</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>occurrence</vocabulary>, like 大切な事 (important matter) or きのうの事 (what happened yesterday).",
  "primaryReading": "こと",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned that reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nYou've done all kinds of <vocabulary>thing</vocabulary>s in your <reading>coat</reading> (こと). If you think about it, you only wear a coat when you have things to do. Try to remember all the things you've done in a coat. It's a lot! Symbolically, your coat = all the things and <vocabulary>occurrence</vocabulary>s you've experienced, and all the <vocabulary>matter</vocabulary>s you've had to deal with in life.",
