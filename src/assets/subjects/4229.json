I guess I haven't seen a cat drinking up boiling milk, but whatever. Just imagine a cat licking up something super hot and freaking out. Cats don't like hot things, which is why this is an aversion to hot foods.",
  "primaryReading": "ねこじた",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the two vocab words separately put together, just as you'd expect from a body-part related kanji. So, 猫 plus 舌 = <reading>ねこじた</reading>. Just remember that 舌 is read here as じた, and not した.",
