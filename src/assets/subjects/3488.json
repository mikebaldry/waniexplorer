  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that <ja>助ける</ja> means \"to help.\" This word, <ja>助かる</ja>, is related, but it's a bit different. It means <vocabulary>to be helped</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be saved</vocabulary>. It's intransitive, so it doesn't take a direct object. Imagine shouting \"I'm saved!\" No direct object, right?\n\nVerbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive like this. You can remember this because if something is <ja>ある</ja>, it's just there, existing, not acting <em>on</em> anything else. That's why verbs that sound like it are often intransitive too!",
  "primaryReading": "たすかる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 助ける, so hopefully you know that word and can apply that knowledge over here.",
