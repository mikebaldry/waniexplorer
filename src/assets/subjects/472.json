The <radical>lid</radical> is inside the <radical>head</radical> for this kanji because it's holding something in. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of <kanji>yen</kanji> coins, the currency of Japan!",
  "readingMnemonic": "What does the word <kanji>yen</kanji> sound like? It sounds like <reading>えん</reading>. Why? because back in the day, Japanese used to have a \"ye\" sound, but now it doesn't. Instead, it's an \"e\" sound, which is why yen = えん!",
