  "meaningMnemonic": "You write the word <kanji>go</kanji> on a <vocabulary>line of text</vocabulary>. See the word \"go\" on that <vocabulary>line</vocabulary>, and think about where you're going.\n\nThis word can also be used for <vocabulary>row</vocabulary>s (horizontal lines in Excel and other spreadsheets).",
  "primaryReading": "ぎょう",
  "readingMnemonic": "There are two on'yomi readings for this kanji, but when it's used to mean lines of text, it's pronounced as ぎょう. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\nYou write out another <vocabulary>line of text</vocabulary> asking for some <reading>gyo</reading>za (ぎょう). You write out that line of text slowly and carefully, in your very best handwriting. Turns out you were going to a gyoza restaurant and you want to make sure you impress the gyoza chef, so that they give you a ton of gyoza.",
