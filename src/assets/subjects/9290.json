  "meaningMnemonic": "Well, you've got <kanji>iron</kanji> and you've got a <kanji>board</kanji>. You'd probably just call it an <vocabulary>iron plate</vocabulary>, though. But this often isn't just any iron plate. If you could guess from the reading, it's often used in cooking as an <vocabulary>iron griddle</vocabulary>, or a <vocabulary>teppan grill</vocabulary>. Ever heard of Teppanyaki?\n\nFiguratively, it means a <vocabulary>sure thing</vocabulary> or a practically guaranteed success. For example, you can use 鉄板 for a racehorse almost certain to win, or a joke that consistently gets big laughs.",

  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. Watch out for the rendaku and you should be good! ",
