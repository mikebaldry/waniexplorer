  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>remainder</kanji>, but you can't really \"to remainder.\" What is something that's similar that would make sense? How about <vocabulary>to leave behind</vocabulary>. This is when you're actually doing the leaving behind too. For example, you eat some food and you leave behind your rice because you're a bad child. You can remember this because of す. Every time you leave some food behind your mom would <reading>sue</reading> you, because she was a terrible mom. Imagine this.",
