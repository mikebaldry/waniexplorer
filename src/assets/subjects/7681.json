  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>point</kanji> so the verb version is something you need to point your finger to do. Picture pointing your finger and pushing a lightswitch <vocabulary>to turn something on</vocabulary>, in this case the light. You won't be able <vocabulary>to switch something on</vocabulary> if you can't point your finger.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou aren't able <vocabulary>to turn</vocabulary> the light on with just one finger though, you need to use <reading>two</reading> (つ). Either you have really weak fingers, or that's a really strong lightswitch. Either way, you need two fingers to switch on the light.",
