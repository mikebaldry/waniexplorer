  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a word that's attached to the end of various other words. Think of a \"road\" as a <vocabulary>way</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>method of</vocabulary> something. For example, the どう in Judo is the soft \"way.\" There are many words that end with 道, and you'll see them later on. For now, know that this means <vocabulary>method of</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>way</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "どう",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word is added to the end of many different words, meaning it's treated like most jukugo (and uses an on'yomi reading). You know the on'yomi reading, so you should be able to read this word. Be sure to drop the 〜 when writing in the reading in the test, though. It's only there to show that it's added onto things and not part of the correct answer.",
