  "primaryReading": "にんずう",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Note that rendaku turns すう into ずう, and since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nDo you know <vocabulary>the number of people</vocabulary> at <reading>Nin</reading>tendo (にん)? It's a big mystery, which is why they hired you to count every single one of them. Good luck!",
