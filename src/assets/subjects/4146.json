The kanji itself means <kanji>permit</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to permit</vocabulary>. It also means <vocabulary>to forgive</vocabulary>, in that \"I'll permit it this time... but only this time.\" Look out for 許さない in TV shows, too. It means \"I won't permit this!\" or \"I won't forgive you!\"",
