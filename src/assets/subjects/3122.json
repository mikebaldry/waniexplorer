Just associate the two things together and it'll be hard to forget (so long as you've heard of Nagoya before - if not, read up about it!).",
  "primaryReading": "なごや",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji (except for 名 and 屋, which are kun'yomi here). If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. For な just think to 名前 (なまえ) which uses the な reading. The \"name\" (名前) of this city is what? It's <reading>Na</reading>goya. Watch out for rendaku changing こ to ご too.",
