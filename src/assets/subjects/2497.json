  "readingMnemonic": "When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn from learning the kanji. To remember this word, you should use a mnemonic. With your <vocabulary>mouth</vocabulary>, make a \"<reading>kuchi</reading> kuchi kou\" (くち) sound. Go ahead, make it. Focus on your mouth and try to imagine each shape it makes while zooming in on it. You're talking to a baby, which is why you're making all these ridiculous noises. Also, instead of \"coo\" at the end, you're saying \"kou,\" because that's the reading of the kanji (こう).\n\nくちくちこう！くちくちこう！ Sounds like something from Arrested Development, actually.",
