  "meaningMnemonic": "When you stick this onto the end of another word that talks about an <kanji>interval of time</kanji> in some way, you're indicating the <vocabulary>amount of time</vocabulary> that has gone past. For example, 二年間 is \"two years.\" 一時間 is \"one hour.\" Any amount of time + 〜間 will make it an \"amount of time\" instead of just a specific time.\n\nNote that 〜間 can be omitted, especially in conversations, when it's clear that you're talking about a duration of time from the context. However, the exception is 時. You always say 〜時間 to refer to the amount of hours, to differentiate from 〜時 (〜o'clock).",
