This can involve natural disasters, sudden riots, or other large-scale disturbances that need military intervention. It can also refer to unannounced warfare.\n\nYou'll most likely see this word used in names for historical events, like the Manshuu Jihen (満州事変), or the Manchurian Incident. The 変 kanji suggests \"change,\" so you know 事変 is only used for historical incidents big enough make things change!",
