Everyone's so busy eating and working and being at school, that they miss this awesome deal, but not you. Everyday at noon you stock up on wholesale stamps. Do you send a lot of mail? No, you probably just collect them. But they were cheap, so who cares!",
  "readingMnemonic": "Oh, one more thing. Going at noon isn't enough, you have to say the password to get them at <kanji>wholesale</kanji> price too. The password is \"<reading>Oh Roshi</reading>\" (おろし). Okay, so maybe that's just the name of the guy there, but it always works when I want to get stamps wholesale so you should do it too!",
