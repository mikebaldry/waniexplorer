  "primaryMeaning": "To Wear",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>wear</kanji> so this word means <vocabulary>to wear</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put on</vocabulary>. You'll need to differentiate it from 着く which means (to arrive), though. Just think of how the る is the <reading>ru</reading>de guy trying to get you to wear things you don't like wearing.",
  "primaryReading": "きる",
  "readingMnemonic": "What do you want <vocabulary>to wear</vocabulary> today? How about a dress made entirely of <reading>key</reading>s (き)? Feel the metal on your skin and the weight on your shoulders. It's not a comfortable thing to put on. Maybe just stick with wearing a single key around your neck next time.",
