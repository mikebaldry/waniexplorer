Think of it this way, the water for a swamp has to come from somewhere right? It starts out up in the mountains and drains out into a swamp in the valley.

You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: The beginning of the word <vocabulary>swamp</vocabulary> is actually pretty similar to this word's reading. さわ = \"swa\"? I'd say it's close enough to make a mnemonic out of in your head.",
