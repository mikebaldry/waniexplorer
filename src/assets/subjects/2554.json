  "meaningMnemonic": "The <kanji>woman</kanji> <kanji>king</kanji> is the <vocabulary>queen</vocabulary>. \n\nYou know this because the woman who comes <em>before</em> the king must be the queen. Imagine this woman in front, leading the king around. Only a queen could do that!\n\nFor a more technical explanation, just remember that when a word consists of two kanji characters, the first kanji often modifies the second. In this case, 女 modifies 王, making it the woman king, a.k.a. the queen!",
  "primaryReading": "じょおう",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. That said, this reading can be easy to confuse with other similar words, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nThe <vocabulary>queen</vocabulary> is named <reading>Jo</reading>-Ann (じょ), or Jo for short, and she's always joking. Hey, wait a minute. Jo… king. 女… king. Jo… おう!! 女王! Get it? When you think of the queen, just remember how much she loves joking (女王).",
