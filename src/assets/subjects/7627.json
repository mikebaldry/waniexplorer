  "primaryReading": "けんぶつ",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is all on'yomi, and you know how to read 物. 見's on'yomi (けん) is a reading you didn't learn with the kanji because it's so much less useful, but you do have to know it here. You've seen it with 発見 a couple levels ago, so that should help. Just imagine taking the samurai <reading>Ken</reading> on an epic <vocabulary>sightseeing</vocabulary> trip. Think of all the things you and Ken will visit!",
