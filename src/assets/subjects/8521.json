  "primaryMeaning": "To Get Dented",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>concave</kanji>, but \"to concave\" doesn't really make sense. So the verb version is <vocabulary>to get dented</vocabulary>. Or, more figuratively, <vocabulary>to feel down</vocabulary>.\n\n凹む is used in a physical sense when the surface of something is dented, collapsed inward, or features some kind of hollow depression. That can be anything from a dented car to even a fit, slimmed-down belly (sort of like the flab is \"dented\" in).\n\nIn a figurative sense, 凹む is used when you're feeling down. Almost like your heart is dented, you know? We all have those days.",
  "primaryReading": "へこむ",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou feel like you've started <vocabulary>to get dented</vocabulary> when you have a <reading>hea</reading>d <reading>co</reading>ld (へこ). Like all that sniffling makes dents on the sides of your nose. It's easy <vocabulary>to feel down</vocabulary> when you have a head cold too, but try not to let it get to you.",
