  "primaryMeaning": "To Put On",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You learned this kanji as \"incur,\" but it can also mean <kanji>cover</kanji>. So 被る means <vocabulary>to put on</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to wear</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to cover oneself with</vocabulary>.\n\n被る is used when you wear things that cover your head or face, like hats, helmets, and masks, or when cover yourself with something, like pulling a blanket over yourself.\n\nFiguratively, 被る can mean taking on a burden or blame, like you're \"covering\" yourself with responsibility. It can also refer to overlapping events — think of it like one event \"covering\" another on a timeline.",
  "primaryReading": "かぶる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe hat you want <vocabulary>to put on</vocabulary> is way too heavy for you. It falls off your head and hits the ground with a loud <reading>KABOO</reading>M (かぶ). You try <vocabulary>to wear</vocabulary> the hat again and pull it down tight, but this time it pulls you to the ground with an even louder KABOOM!",
