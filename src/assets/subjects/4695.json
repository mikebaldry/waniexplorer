  "primaryMeaning": "To Touch Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>touch</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to touch something</vocabulary>.\n\n触る is used when someone does the touching. It's not used to describe objects touching each other.\n\nNote that 触る can be used with either the particle に or を, like 手に触る or 手を触る (to touch a hand). Using に simply marks the location you touch, while using を highlights your action of touching that specific area or object. So the former is intransitive and the latter is transitive, though there's some debate about that.",
  "primaryReading": "さわる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou only like <vocabulary>to touch</vocabulary> things that are <reading>sour</reading> (さわ). Lemons, limes, grapefruits, you name it. There's something about sour things that just makes you want to touch them. ",
