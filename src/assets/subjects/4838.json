  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Replaced",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>replace</kanji>, and this word means <vocabulary>to be replaced</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be substituted</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>to be switched</vocabulary>.\n\nWondering about the difference between 代わる and 替わる? 代わる is used when someone or something takes the place of another, like filling in for a sick coworker. Whereas 替わる is used when things or situations switch places or are replaced with something new, like when talking about generations changing or a new governmental cabinet taking over.\n\nThis verb is intransitive, meaning it doesn't take a direct object. You'll sometimes see it with the particle を, though, because the を is showing a \"path\" rather than a direct object in this case. For example, 席を替わる (to switch seats) indicates your location is moving from one seat to another. Likewise, 電話を替わる indicates that a call is being handed off to another person.",
