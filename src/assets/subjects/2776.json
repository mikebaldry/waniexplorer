  "meaningMnemonic": "The meaning of this word is pretty strange, having very little to do with the kanji meaning you learned. This word means <vocabulary>to carry something out</vocabulary>. Maybe you can think of it like someone is saying \"<reading>You</reading> (う) <kanji>go</kanji> do that task!\" to get yourself <vocabulary>to carry out</vocabulary> the task. Whatever you do, just know this is a weird exception word, so you may have to do some extra work to remember it.",
  "primaryReading": "おこなう",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is also a strange exception. You have to remember the おこな portion. Maybe this mnemonic will help: \n\nYou have <vocabulary>to carry out</vocabulary> a task but don’t know how. “<reading>Oh</reading>, <reading>Cona</reading>n!” (おこな) you shout. You always shout “Oh, Conan!” when you have to carry out something tough, because it summons the spirit of Detective Conan. He’s a genius, so his spirit can help you with anything at all. Even your WaniKani reviews. Go ahead and try it now. Shout “Oh, Conan!” Did you do it? Good. Now carry out those reviews!",
