You’ve been eating them for three hours now and the spiciness from the peppers is really burning your tongue. Throw in the towel, it’s time to quit the contest.\n\nThis kanji has another meaning too:\n\nEating isn't the only thing that makes your <radical>tongue</radical> <radical>spicy</radical>, so do certain <kanji>word</kanji>s. Say your favorite words out loud right now. Feel them on your tongue. Words are the spicy food of language!",
