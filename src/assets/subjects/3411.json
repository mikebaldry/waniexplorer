However, 小 uses the kun'yomi reading and 文 is an exception here, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this:\n\nYou learned your lowercase letters from <reading>子</reading> <reading>Moe</reading> (こも). That's right, after Moe taught you all the letters, his son 子 Moe taught you the lowercase ones. Such teamwork.",
