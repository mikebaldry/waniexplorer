In some cases, this can also refer to the type of <vocabulary>fog</vocabulary> you'd find on a window or your glasses.\n\nDespite being a noun in Japanese, you'll actually see this translated as the adjective \"cloudy\" in English a lot. Don't let that fool you, though, it still behaves as a noun in Japanese! It's just another example of word types not quite matching up between English and Japanese.",
