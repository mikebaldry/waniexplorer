It is also <vocabulary>many</vocabulary> (or you could say <vocabulary>much</vocabulary>). Speaking of which, there are so many kanji to learn, ammiright?",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThink of something that is <vocabulary>many</vocabulary>. Doesn't matter what it is as long as you imagine a ridiculous number of them. Many of them. So many that they start avalanching into you and crushing you. The last thing you yell is \"<reading>おお</reading>!!!\" as you get smushed.",
