  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The reading of 文 is a bit of an exception here. It uses a shortened version of the on'yomi もん, which is も. Here's a mnemonic to remember this:\n\nYou know all the <vocabulary>letters of the alphabet</vocabulary> only because of <reading>Mo</reading>e (も). If it wasn't for your buddy Moe teaching you all the letters, you probably wouldn't even be able to read today. Thanks Moe!",
