  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji means <kanji>crotch</kanji> and the vocabulary also means <vocabulary>crotch</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>groin</vocabulary>. This word is a little less specific than 股間, which you already learned. It can even be used to refer to the thigh, though in that case the reading is usually もも and it's mostly written in hiragana or katakana.\n\nThis can also be used for a <vocabulary>fork</vocabulary> in a road or path, which makes sense when you think about it, doesn't it?",
  "primaryReading": "また",
  "readingMnemonic": "You learned the on’yomi for this kanji, but like many kanji it takes the kun’yomi when used by itself. You haven't learned the kun’yomi yet, so here’s a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou’ve spilled something on your <vocabulary>crotch</vocabulary> again (また, get it?) but your pants are so stained at this point that it doesn’t even <reading>matter</reading> (また).",
