  "readingMnemonic": "The readings for these kanji are the kun'yomi readings. Just think of this word as two separate words put together (手 and 作る). The る in 作る gets changed to り because it's an adjective, and the つ in つくり gets changed to づ because of the way the words are combined with each other. You should know most of the reading that is in this word, though it will probably take a little bit of thinking to sort out the little changes in those readings.",
