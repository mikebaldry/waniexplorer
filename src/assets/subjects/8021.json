Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nYou seem <vocabulary>to nod</vocabulary> your head a lot when you're at the <reading>una</reading>gi <reading>zoo</reading> (うなず). Unagi zoos are really rare and hard to get into. So while you're there, keep nodding to everyone because you're so honored to be there!\n\n肯く also has two readings. うなずく is the standard, but うなづく is more and more acceptable these days too. Luckily they sound pretty similar (if not the same), so they should be easy to remember!",
