  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 燃やす means \"to burn something\" or \"to set on fire”? Well, 燃える is the version that means <vocabulary>to burn</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be on fire</vocabulary>. You might say that paper and wood 燃える easily, for example. And if your house is 燃えている, you're in trouble.\n\nYou can remember this slightly different meaning for 燃える because of the える part, which refers to the letter \"L.\" And the \"L\" stands for \"love\" — as in your passionate, burning love for kanji.",
