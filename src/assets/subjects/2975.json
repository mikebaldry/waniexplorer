If you need a refresher, here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou're part of a special <vocabulary>group</vocabulary>. It is the <reading>cumi</reading>n group, and they deal with all things cumin (the spice or seed). Smell the cumin. Touch it. Taste it. You live and breathe the stuff, because you are the president of this cumin group.\n\nP.S. This can also be spelled <ja>組み</ja> (same reading: くみ) when it's a counter for groups, like ひと組み or ふた組み.
