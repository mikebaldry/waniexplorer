  "meaningMnemonic": "You've hopefully seen the word <ja>決める</ja> before. This is similar, except instead of deciding something, something gets decided. Rules are decided, a schedule gets decided — that kind of thing. It's intransitive, so it doesn't take a direct object. So <ja>決まる</ja> means <vocabulary>to be decided</vocabulary>.\n\nVerbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive like this. You can remember this because if something is <ja>ある</ja>, it's just there, existing, not acting <em>on</em> anything else. That's why verbs that sound like it are often intransitive too!",
