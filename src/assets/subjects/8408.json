  "meaningMnemonic": "Look in the sea and you'll see what looks like a <kanji>crow</kanji> moving under the water and it's a <kanji>thief</kanji>! It's stealing from all the fish. As it comes closer you see that it isn't a crow, it's a <vocabulary>squid</vocabulary>. Or a <vocabulary>cuttlefish</vocabulary>? One or the other.",
  "primaryReading": "いか",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this word is completely irregular, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nYou call the fish police to arrest that thieving <vocabulary>squid</vocabulary>, but it jumps into it's <reading>ea</reading>gle <reading>ca</reading>r (いか) and makes a swift getaway. In case you didn't know, an eagle car is an eagle moonlighting as a car. The eagle car is zooming up into the sky, so there's no way the fish police can catch it now.",
