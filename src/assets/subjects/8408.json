  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this word is completely irregular, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nYou call the fish police to arrest that thieving <vocabulary>squid</vocabulary>, but it jumps into it's <reading>ea</reading>gle <reading>ca</reading>r (いか) and makes a swift getaway. In case you didn't know, an eagle car is an eagle moonlighting as a car. The eagle car is zooming up into the sky, so there's no way the fish police can catch it now.",
