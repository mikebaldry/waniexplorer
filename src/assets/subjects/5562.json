  "primaryMeaning": "To Damage Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji means <kanji>wound</kanji>, and this verb is transitive, so it means <vocabulary>to damage something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to injure something</vocabulary>.\n\nYou can use it to talk about parts of your body, so you'll sometimes see it used interchangeably with 痛める. The difference is that it's objectively focussing on the damage, not the pain. That's why 傷める can be used for objects like cars and furniture, too, whereas 痛める is only for people and body parts.",
