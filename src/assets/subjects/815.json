Without a heart, you’d have no blood pumping and you would start to die. This would make it increasingly harder to draw breath and get oxygen to stay alive.",

Well a smelly <reading>sock</reading> (そく) can work just as well. Socks get really stinky and their stench is powerful enough to revive someone who isn’t drawing breath.",
