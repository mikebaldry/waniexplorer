  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>collect</kanji> and this verb is transitive, meaning the action is done to something or someone. So this verb means things like <vocabulary>to collect something</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to gather something</vocabulary>.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhen you only have one thing, there's only one thing. Nothing is collected. But when you have two... \"<reading>ah two</reading>!\" (あつ). Now you're starting <vocabulary>to collect something</vocabulary>.",
