To remember the reading of this word, here's a mnemonic: \n\n\"I want you <vocabulary>to come</vocabulary> to the <reading>coo</reading>l (く) side, Luke,\" says Darth Vader.\n\"What?\" replies Luke.\n\nJust replace this line into the famous line from Star Wars. Say it out loud. Do the Vader voice. It'll help you to remember.",
