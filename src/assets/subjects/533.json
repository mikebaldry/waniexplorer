  "readingMnemonic": "\"You want to know the <kanji>number</kanji> to the hatch?\" yells an old voice from inside. You say \"yes,\" and the voice gives you the numbers and you're in! You go down into the prison, where there is one prisoner: Grandpa <reading>ごう</reading>いち.\n\nNote: For the ごう reading mnemonics, we use Grandpa ごういち because こういち is used for the こう reading. So just remember that ごう comes from Koichi's grandpa ごういち.",
