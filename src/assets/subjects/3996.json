It's the front we present to the world, the <vocabulary>public behavior</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>public stance</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>social niceties</vocabulary> that maintain harmony.\n\n建前 is very important in Japan. For example, you might find yourself invited to an acquaintance's home out of courtesy, with the expectation that you’ll decline (also out of courtesy!). A host of a party may say \"just bring yourself,\" but guests know this could be 建前, and considering their own 建前, they bring a small gift anyways.  People can also be reluctant to say \"no\" to things, like drinks with coworkers when they really want to go home, and may not to show it when they find situations inconvenient or unpleasant. So you might need some guesswork to peek behind the 建前 that people build up in front of themselves!",
  "primaryReading": "たてまえ",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is pretty strange. It's a lot like 建物 in that it's read as たて, which is like the word 建てる even though the て isn't showing here. So, you'll have to remember it's read like 建てる but the て gets pushed into the kanji.",
