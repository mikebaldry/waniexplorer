  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou decide <vocabulary>to cover</vocabulary> yourself with a sheet because you want to pretend to be a ghost. But covering yourself isn't enough. If you really want people to believe in your disguise you have to say, \"<reading>おお</reading>!\" Otherwise they'll think you're a covered chair or a bush. If you おお at them they'll definitely know you're a ghost covered in that sheet.",
