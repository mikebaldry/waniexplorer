  "meaningMnemonic": "This is the <radical>ear</radical> radical, since it looks like an ear. As much as a radical can, anyway. Those two middle lines are the ridges that guide the sound into your ear, and the lines that stick out to the right are where the ear attaches to your head.\n\nIf you think about it, ears are just eyes that see sound. Whoa, dude… That explains the eye (目) and ear (耳) radical resemblance. Just remember this one is \"ear\" because ears stick out, just like the lines sticking out of the side of this radical.",
