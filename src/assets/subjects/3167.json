  "primaryMeaning": "To End",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>end</kanji>, so this verb means <vocabulary>to end</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be over</vocabulary>.\n\nVerbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive, and 終わる is usually intransitive too. But sometimes it can be transitive and take a direct object. Kind of like \"to end\" in English — you can say the class ends (intransitive) or a teacher ends their class (transitive).",
  "primaryReading": "おわる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThis situation has <vocabulary>to end</vocabulary>. You're the <reading>ower</reading> (おわ) of a lot of money. For this to end, you need to pay back all that money. Try to think of ways to stop being an ower so this stressful situation can end!",
