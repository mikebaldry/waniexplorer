  "primaryMeaning": "To Divide",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>divide</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to divide</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to split something</vocabulary>.\n\nIt can also mean <vocabulary>to break something</vocabulary>, as in ワイングラスを割る (to break a wine glass). After all, you’re technically dividing the object into parts if you break it, right?",
