So お盆 also means <vocabulary>tray</vocabulary>, or refers to the <vocabulary>ancestral festival</vocabulary> also known as Obon.\n\nUsually, the context will tell you which meaning for お盆 is being used, but you can also distinguish between them by the pitch accent. お盆 for \"tray\" uses a Low-High-High accent (like our female audio), and お盆 for \"ancestral festival\" uses a Low-High-Low accent (like our male audio).",
