  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>release</kanji> and the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to be released</vocabulary>. You can differentiate this one from 放す (to release) by thinking that it's pretty <reading>rare</reading> (れる) for you to be released by your arch nemesis. He just let you go, strangely. How rare.",
  "primaryReading": "はなれる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading comes from 放す. As long as you know that word you can apply that reading over here as well.",
