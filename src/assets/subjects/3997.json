  "primaryReading": "こい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Your <vocabulary>love</vocabulary> isn't toward a person, it's toward this giant <reading>Koi</reading> (こい) fish you met the other day. The fish is just so... so... handsome! You get hearts popping above your head every time you think about this koi!",
