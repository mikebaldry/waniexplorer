Who are you? What are you? All you know is you’re <kanji>somebody</kanji>, but you don’t know who that somebody is.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You’re falling down this metaphorical slide… And then you hit <kanji>somebody</kanji>… and you hit them really hard. On your metaphorical <reading>shin</reading> (しん). You split it in half and it’s at a right angle. The pain is incredible (shins have a lot of nerves!). It may have been broken, and you may not be able to walk correctly again… metaphorically speaking, that is.",
