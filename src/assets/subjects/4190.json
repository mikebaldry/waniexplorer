It's delicious and really good for you. Seaweed is kind of like cloth in the sea, right? Well, this young cloth is nice and soft and thin, like wakame. I imagine young people are soft and thin too, which is why the young cloth gets to be wakame.",

  "readingMnemonic": "若い uses the same reading you learned with the kanji, but the reading for 布 is totally irregular. If you can figure out the meaning, you can use that to remember the reading (since they're the same), but here's a mnemonic to help you just in case:\n\nYou're eating <vocabulary>wakame</vocabulary> and you suddenly spot a <reading>目</reading> (め) looking up at you. You didn't know seaweed had eyes!",
