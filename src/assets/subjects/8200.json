You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou should try <vocabulary>to be frugal</vocabulary> when you go to the <reading>ocea</reading>n (おし). There are lots of things to buy, like delicious food, sun hats, and tofugu dolls, but you really shouldn't spend all your money there. Try to plan on spending less when you head to the ocean next time, okay?",
