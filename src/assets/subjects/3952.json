  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is pretty weird, but then again so are people from Osaka (just kidding, Osakazens!). The 大 reads like おお from おおきい. Then, 阪 uses the kun'yomi reading as well, which you didn't learn. That being said, doesn't this kanji look like 坂, which also means slope? Well, it shares a kun'yomi reading as well, so if you've seen 坂 you can apply that reading over to here, making おおさか. Then again, if you know this word means <vocabulary>Osaka</vocabulary> you probably can figure out how to write it too. Don't forget the double おお though!",
