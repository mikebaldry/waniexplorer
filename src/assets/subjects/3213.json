  "meaningMnemonic": "A <kanji>language</kanji> about <kanji>thing</kanji>s. This is a confusing one. Just think of it more like someone talking about things, anything, really. Someone who just talks about things is someone who tells stories. So, this word means <vocabulary>tale</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>story</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>legend</vocabulary> (not the Tom Cruise one, though).",
  "primaryReading": "ものがたり",
  "readingMnemonic": "Both kanji take the kun'yomi here. For 物, that's もの, which you learned with the vocabulary 物. You learned the kun'yomi for 語 with the verb 語る, but here it becomes がたり because of rendaku, and the り is tucked inside the kanji.\n\nMaybe you've already heard the word ものがたり too. It's in some film and book names. If you haven't, and you find this reading hard to remember, think of a story about an infamous <reading>Gatling</reading> (がたり) gun that wandered the land, mowing everything down in its path. It's a terrible legend, but what if it were true???",
