  "primaryMeaning": "To Roll",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>scroll</kanji>. But, you don't \"to scroll.\" What do you do to scrolls, though? You roll them up, making this word \"<vocabulary>to roll</vocabulary>.\"\n\nThis word can also mean <vocabulary>to wind</vocabulary>, like when winding thread or a watch, or <vocabulary>to wrap</vocabulary> when involving a rolling or coiling motion, like wrapping sushi in seaweed or wrapping a cozy scarf around your neck.",
  "primaryReading": "まく",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The thing you are rolling up is your <reading>ma</reading> (ま). She's going wild again, so you throw her into a blanket and roll her up to hold her down.",
