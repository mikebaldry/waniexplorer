You haven't learned this reading for 違 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you find yourself in <vocabulary>violation</vocabulary> of the law just pull out your pet <reading>ea</reading>gle (い). Eagles are so majestic, they'll forget all about your transgression and let you go. If you're going to go be anti-something make sure you bring that eagle. People seem to care more about animals than other people like that.",
