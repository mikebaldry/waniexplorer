  "readingMnemonic": "The reading might look a little strange, but makes sense once you get it. You already know that the verb 建てる means \"to build\", and that a もの is a \"thing\". Now just remove the る part from the verb to make it a noun, combine it with もの, and we get <reading>たてもの</reading>! Just remember that it’s all kun’yomi since it comes from the verb 建てる.",
