  "primaryMeaning": "To Sell",
  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that the kanji means <kanji>sell</kanji> and the word 売る means \"to sell something.\" 売れる is the intransitive version of this, so this word means for something <vocabulary>to sell</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be sold</vocabulary>.\n\nIt can also be used for something <vocabulary>to sell well</vocabulary>, that often results in that thing beginning <vocabulary>to be popular</vocabulary>.\n\nYou can remember this because it's rare (れる) to see something sell really well to the point where it gets popular!",
  "primaryReading": "うれる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already, so you should be able to read it! It's the same reading as 売る where you're trying to sell some <reading>U</reading>ni (う)!",
