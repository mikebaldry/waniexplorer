  "meaningMnemonic": "ハート is of course \"heart\" and you know that 形 means <kanji>shape</kanji>. You've probably already figured this one out. It's <vocabulary>heart shaped</vocabulary>. \n\nYou can add this kanji to all sorts of other things too to say \"____ shaped.\" Give it a try!",
  "primaryReading": "はーとがた",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for the kanji portion uses the kun'yomi reading. This is kind of like the reading you already learned for 形 just without the ち part. And rendaku happens too, so it becomes がた. If you can remember that, you should be able to remember this reading too!",
