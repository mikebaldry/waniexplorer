  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this is an exception, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nJapanese <vocabulary>pumpkin</vocabulary>s don't taste like American pumpkins. They taste more like <reading>can</reading>ned <reading>bo</reading>iled <reading>cho</reading>colate (かぼちゃ). Oh, you don't know that either? Well then just taste the pumpkin and you'll know what that tastes like too.\n\nThis word is also sometimes read なんきん, especially in the east of Japan.",
