  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 表 meant both <kanji>express</kanji> and <kanji>surface</kanji>? This expands on the second meaning, making this <vocabulary>the front</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>the surface</vocabulary>. \n\n表 refers to the visible, outward-facing side of something, in contrast to the hidden, back side. It's used for surfaces on display, like the front of a building, the face of a coin, the cover of a book, or the top surface of a package.",
  "primaryReading": "おもて",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou're standing there, staring at <vocabulary>the front</vocabulary> of this building. You spend some time gazing at it before you realize what it is. \"<reading>Oh</reading>, <reading>mote</reading>l (おもて),\" you say aloud. <vocabulary>The surface</vocabulary> of this building really gave it away. \"Oh, motel!\"",
