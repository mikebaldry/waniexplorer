  "primaryMeaning": "To Reach The Peak Of Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji itself means <kanji>extreme</kanji>. The verb vocab version isn't \"to extreme\" because that wouldn't make sense. Instead, you bring something to extremes, making this <vocabulary>to reach the peak of something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to perfect</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to reach the extreme</vocabulary>.\n\n極める commonly means reaching the highest level of proficiency or excellence in a particular skill, art, or field. It can also mean taking something to the extreme, like being crazy busy.",
  "primaryReading": "きわめる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you go <vocabulary>to reach the peak of something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to perfect</vocabulary> something, you tend to go a little overboard, so there has to be a <reading>key</reading> <reading>wo</reading>rd (きわ) that other people can say to remind you to calm down a little. “PINEAPPLE! PINEAPPLE!”",
