  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji <ja>受</ja> means <kanji>accept</kanji> and this verb is related. It means <vocabulary>to get accepted</vocabulary>, usually into something good like a university or a new job. It can also mean <vocabulary>to pass</vocabulary>, often in the context of a test or an exam.\n\nThis is an intransitive verb, so no direct object is needed. A hint for this is that it ends with okurigana that rhyme with ある, and those kinds of verbs tend to be intransitive. Also, be careful: in English you'd use the transitive expression \"pass a test,\" but in Japanese you'd say 試験に受かる. Kind of like saying you pass <em>in</em> the exam — so it's still intransitive!",
  "primaryReading": "うかる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Here's a little mnemonic to help ya remember:\n\n<vocabulary>To get accepted</vocabulary> into this program, you have to juggle <reading>u</reading>nis (う)—yes, those spiky sea urchins! Handling uni is tough, but if you want <vocabulary>to pass</vocabulary> the test and get accepted, you've got to master the uni challenge.",
