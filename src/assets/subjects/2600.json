  "meaningMnemonic": "This word has the same meaning that you learned with the kanji: <vocabulary>part</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>portion</vocabulary>. By extension, it can also mean <vocabulary>content</vocabulary>, as in \"alcohol content\" because that's the portion of alcohol in a drink.\n\nThis word is used for fractions, too, as in one third or one quarter. Again, you can see how this links to \"parts\" and \"portions\", right?",
  "primaryReading": "ぶん",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word is usually combined with a word or phrase indicating whose part or portion you're referring to. That's probably why this single kanji vocab word uses the on'yomi instead of the kun'yomi reading. Check out the common word combinations to see what we're talking about!\n\nAnd when it means <vocabulary>part</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>portion</vocabulary>, it's read ぶん. Probably because your buns come in two parts. Ohoho.",
