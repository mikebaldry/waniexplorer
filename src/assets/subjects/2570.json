  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The 本 is read just how you learned it, but the 日 reading is sort of an exception here, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou've finally arrived in <vocabulary>Japan</vocabulary> and immediately fall down on your <reading>knee</reading>s (に). After two excruciatingly long flights, you've finally made it. You're here. This is Japan. Now get up off your knees, people are starting to stare.",
