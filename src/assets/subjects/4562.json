  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>respond</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to respond</vocabulary>.\n\n応じる is a formal word that describes acting favorably in response to a call, request, or demand. For example, 注文に応じる goes beyond just taking orders; it means adapting appropriately and fulfilling them.",
