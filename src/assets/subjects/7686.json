  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>language</kanji>, so when you do language you're going <vocabulary>to talk</vocabulary> about something. Maybe you're going <vocabulary>to tell</vocabulary> a story, or the truth.\n\nThis verb is transitive, so it generally takes a direct object in Japanese, even though the English translations might not.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nSometimes when you're trying <vocabulary>to talk</vocabulary> about something, there will be that one person who always cuts you off <vocabulary>to tell</vocabulary> their own story. We call them language <reading>cutter</reading>s (かた). They cut you off and make everyone pay attention to what they're saying. Don't be a language cutter.",
