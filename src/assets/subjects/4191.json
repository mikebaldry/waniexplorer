  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You take your <kanji>cloth</kanji> and put it on top of your head. It's there because right at <reading>noon</reading> (ぬの) the sun is in the middle of the sky and burns your scalp. So, you cover it with a cloth. Imagine yourself setting an alarm for noon to help you to focus on the noon part.",
