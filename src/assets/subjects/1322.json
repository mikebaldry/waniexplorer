Since you’re in a cage, you actually fashioned this comb yourself, so it’s a little messed up, missing a prong. You’re working on improving it in your spare time, and you also use it to style your mop.",

You’d stolen many a car in your day, but you finally got caught in the act of stealing a car, and now you’re spending all of your spare time in that cage, just combing your hair.",
