  "primaryMeaning": "To Urge",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>urge</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to urge</vocabulary>.\n\nAt its core, 迫る means <vocabulary>to approach</vocabulary>, like a deadline or danger drawing near. This idea extends to urging someone because it's like you're coming really close to them, <vocabulary>to press</vocabulary> them into action.",
  "primaryReading": "せまる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nDo you prefer <vocabulary>to urge</vocabulary> people to do something, or <vocabulary>to press</vocabulary> them to do it? It depends on how you want <vocabulary>to approach</vocabulary> them. But it's all <reading>sema</reading>ntics (せま) because they're basically the same.",
