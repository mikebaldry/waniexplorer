  "primaryMeaning": "To Go Beyond",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>go beyond</kanji> so the verb vocab version is also <vocabulary>to go beyond</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is very similar in meaning to 越える. Both can refer to overcoming some physical object or passing beyond a certain amount of time. However, 越す tends to sound a little less intense, while 越える really focuses on the physical or emotional challenge of overcoming a certain milestone. For example, while 山を越す simply refers to crossing a mountain, 山を越える gives the impression that crossing the mountain is a difficulty you've overcome.",
  "primaryReading": "こす",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 越える. So if you know that you know this too! In case you need a reminder, here's the mnemonic:\n\n<vocabulary>To go beyond</vocabulary> <reading>child</reading> (こ) years in order to become an adult, you have to be 18 years old in the USA, and 20 years old in Japan.",
