  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>raise</kanji> so the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to be raised</vocabulary>. \n\nP.S. This word is for when you are being raised, not when you are doing the raising of someone. That's <vocabulary>育てる</vocabulary>. You'll learn it later.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhen you were raised, you were raised completely on <reading>soda</reading> (そだ). That's all you drank. No water, no juice... just tons and tons of soda. Imagine this.",
