  "primaryMeaning": "To Save",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>savings</kanji>, so the verb vocab version would become <vocabulary>to save</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to save up</vocabulary>. \n\n貯える means to set something aside for future needs or emergencies, like saving money or storing water.",
  "primaryReading": "たくわえる",
  "readingMnemonic": "This shares a reading with 蓄える, which makes sense, as the meanings of them are very close to each other! If you’re not sure you remember the reading, here’s the mnemonic once more to help you remember it:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to save</vocabulary> up things, so you <reading>take one</reading> (たくわ) and put it aside, then take one more and put it aside again. Repeat this process of taking one over and over and you’ll quickly <vocabulary>save up</vocabulary> lots of things.",
