  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Transmitted",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>transmit</kanji>, and this verb version is <vocabulary>to be transmitted</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be conveyed</vocabulary>. It's intransitive, so it doesn't take a direct object. A message is transmitted, or your feelings are conveyed — that kind of thing.\n\nVerbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive like this. You can remember this because if something is <ja>ある</ja>, it's just there, existing, not acting <em>on</em> anything else. That's why verbs that sound like it are often intransitive too!",
  "primaryReading": "つたわる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\n\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 伝える.",
