You've seen it with 発見 a couple levels ago, so that should help. Still, here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nIn this case, just think about how <reading>Ken</reading> the samurai has an <vocabulary>opinion</vocabulary> on everything. Ken is such a know-it-all, and you're better off agreeing with his opinions. He's a samurai after all!",
