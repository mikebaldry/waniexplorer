The kanji means <kanji>dense</kanji>, and this can also mean <vocabulary>dense</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>thick</vocabulary> in some contexts, like if you’re describing fog, or body hair! More generally, it can be used for anything that’s highly concentrated, so you can use it for things like <vocabulary>deep</vocabulary> colors, or <vocabulary>strong</vocabulary> coffee too!",
