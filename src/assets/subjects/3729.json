  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You go up to <vocabulary>Buddha</vocabulary>. You want to rub his head for good luck, because that's what you hear is good to do. Right before you touch him, he backs off and says, \"Whoa! I'm <reading>hot, okay</reading>?\" (ほとけ). You touch him and it burns your hand clean off. \n\nImagine saying \"hot, okay?\" in a strange accent to help you to remember.",
