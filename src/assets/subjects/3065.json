  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou begin <vocabulary>to count</vocabulary> vocabulary words. You're out of control and you can't stop. One after another. Scientists have to come in, but they can't figure out the <reading>cause</reading> (かぞ) of your counting. They drag you away to a padded cell where they keep testing you trying to figure out the cause of your craziness.",
