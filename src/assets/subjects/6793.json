  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji, but you haven't learned this for either 辛 or 抱 yet, so let's use a mnemonic to remember it: \n\nThink about how much <vocabulary>patience</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>endurance</vocabulary> your <reading>shin</reading>s (しん) need to have to be good at <reading>bo</reading>wling (ぼう). You won't get any strikes with weak shins!\n\nNote that the ぼう reading is the rendaku'd reading for 抱.\n",
