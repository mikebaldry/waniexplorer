You'll usually see this word without the 吐 kanji, as in 嘘つき, but for now let's learn its kanji reading! \n\nYou can't just tell one <vocabulary>lie</vocabulary>, it always turns into <reading>two</reading> (つ). Kind of like a chip or pretzel, you can't just have one. With lies, you have to open your mouth for two more. And then two more.... and... well you get it.",
