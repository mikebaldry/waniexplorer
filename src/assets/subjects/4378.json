  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember 広い? Well this is like that, except a verb. When something does the action of getting <kanji>wide</kanji>, it means <vocabulary>to spread out</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to extend</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to stretch</vocabulary>.\n\nYou already learned <ja>広げる</ja>, which is used when you spread SOMETHING. But <ja>広がる</ja> is intransitive, so it doesn't take a direct object. Like: The sea spreads out before you. See? No direct object.\n\nActually, verbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive like this. You can remember this because if something is <ja>ある</ja>, it's just there, existing, not acting <em>on</em> anything else. That's why verbs that sound like it are often intransitive too!",
