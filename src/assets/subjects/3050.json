  "meaningMnemonic": "This word is a little tricky — at first, the combination of <kanji>mix</kanji> and <kanji>number in a series</kanji> doesn't seem to add up to <vocabulary>police box</vocabulary>, but there's a catch. This word is actually an abbreviated combo of two other words: The 交 comes from 交替 (in rotation) and the 番 comes from 立番 (standing watch).\n\nA <vocabulary>police box</vocabulary> is basically a tiny community police station staffed by one or two officers. It's something that is not common in many Western countries, but it is pretty much all over Japan. \n\n",
