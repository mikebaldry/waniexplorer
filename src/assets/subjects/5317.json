Basically, it's for any form of shooting you do with a camera!",

  "readingMnemonic": "<vocabulary>To take a picture</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to take a video</vocabulary>… You \"take\" all these things. And how do you say \"to take\" in Japanese? It's <reading>取る</reading> (とる), which happens to share a reading with this word. Different kanji but related meanings, and exactly the same reading!",
