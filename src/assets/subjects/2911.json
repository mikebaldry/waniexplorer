  "meaningMnemonic": "The hiragana attached to this word doesn't suggest it's a verb or an adjective, so we can assume it's a noun. While 後で (you may or may not have seen this word yet) means \"after,\" this one means all the other meanings you learned with the kanji: <vocabulary>behind</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>back</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>rear</vocabulary>. Think of the ろ as a hint. It's like saying you're on the \"road\" (ろ) and you're driving so fast you're leaving everything \"behind.\"",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nContinue to think you're driving on this road. You hit something, then look <vocabulary>behind</vocabulary> you, seeing you hit a cow. Know the word for cow in Japanese? It's うし, which is also the reading for this word.",
