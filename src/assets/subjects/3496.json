  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that the kanji means <kanji>yonder</kanji>, which is like \"over there.\" This is the verb version of \"yonder.\" That being said, \"to yonder\" isn't really a thing, so you have to think of what happens when you \"look yonder.\" This word means <vocabulary>to turn toward</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to face</vocabulary>. You're looking yonder, but you have to turn towards said yonder to look that way.\n\nThis word can also mean <vocabulary>to be suitable</vocabulary>, as in a good fit for a job, role, or situation. After all, you turn toward the things you’re most suitable for, right?",
  "primaryReading": "むく",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou turn <vocabulary>to face</vocabulary> a new direction and look out into the distance. There is a single cow out there. It turns to face you too, and says <reading>moo</reading> (む).",
