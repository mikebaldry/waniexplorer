Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nOnly <vocabulary>this month</vocabulary>, your pet <reading>con</reading>dor <reading>gets</reading> (こんげつ) to sleep in your bed. You usually keep it in a cage, but once a year, you make an exception. And that's this month. How cute!",
