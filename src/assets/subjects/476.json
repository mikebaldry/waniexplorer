  "readingMnemonic": "There are so many on'yomi for this kanji, but since this kanji is so important and common, you'll end up learning them all eventually whether you want to or not. For now, you're only going to have to learn one of the readings, and that one is にち. \n\nThe <kanji>sun</kanji> is so hot. It focused its rays to take out one man... and that man is Friedrich <reading>Nietzsche</reading> (にち), famous philosopher. He philosophized one too many things about the sun, so the sun decided it was time he paid.",
