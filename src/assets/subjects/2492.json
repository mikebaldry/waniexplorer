  "meaningMnemonic": "This word means <vocabulary>to climb</vocabulary>. You can tell this word is a verb because it ends with an う sound (る, in this case). Its meaning is similar to the meaning of the 上 kanji, which is \"above.\" So this word is all about moving \"above\" something (in other words, climbing!) ",
  "primaryReading": "のぼる",
  "readingMnemonic": "上る consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, so it will use the kun'yomi reading of the kanji. For 上, there are multiple kun'yomi readings, and you didn't learn this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou want <vocabulary>to climb</vocabulary> the mountain, but a gruff old man grabs your shoulder and says \"<reading>No bo</reading>y, you ain't climbing that thing, not today.\" If you're not a boy, think about how weird it is that he called you a boy. If you are a grown man, think how you wish he called you \"dude\" or something, not \"boy.\" If you're a boy, well... think about how appropriate it is that he said \"no boy.\"",
