  "primaryMeaning": "With Trouble",
  "meaningMnemonic": "When there's nothing but <kanji>fold</kanji>s and <kanji>angle</kanji>s, you have quite a mess. This word means <vocabulary>with trouble</vocabulary> because you certainly aren't traversing along a nice, flat piece of space-time, are you? Nah, it's all angled and folded.\n\n折角 is one of those tricky Japanese words that doesn’t have one neat translation in English. The nuance is that something has come about with trouble, either through someone’s efforts, or a stroke of luck. It often implies regret, and is used in situations where you want to express that <vocabulary>valuable</vocabulary> opportunities, advice, or hard work were in vain for some reason. It’s also used to underline a <vocabulary>rare</vocabulary> chance that shouldn’t be missed.",
  "primaryReading": "せっかく",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Watch out for the せつ changing to せっ, though. Another thing you have to go through <vocabulary>with trouble</vocabulary>, I'm afraid.",
