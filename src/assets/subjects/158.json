Or, if you want, you can imagine it as a snake head, with its face facing to the right (see its open mouth?). We may use either when learning a kanji, but for now you can pick the one that fits best with your memorization style. Just make sure you get to snake when you see this radical.\n\n*Also note that sometimes the coil isn't totally completed (where it connects in the middle of the vertical line).",
