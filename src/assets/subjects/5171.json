  "primaryMeaning": "Honorable",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. The kanji means <kanji>pure</kanji>, but this is an adjective that often describes behavior or character, so it means <vocabulary>honorable</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>dignified</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>gracious</vocabulary>.\n\nHow does that work? I guess if you can stay pure despite a tough situation, you must be pretty honorable and dignified. You're the type who can make a gracious apology (潔い謝り), have a dignified manner (潔い態度), or even die honorably (潔く死ぬ).\n\n潔い is about being strong and doing the right thing without hesitation, especially when it's hard. For example, when someone admits their mistake honestly or handles a tough situation with courage, you can say they're 潔い. It's a way to praise someone for being straightforward and admirable in difficult times.",
  "primaryReading": "いさぎよい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Oh man, the reading for this is... like... crazy. First part can be something like <reading>i</reading>t's <reading>soggy</reading> (いさぎ)... then the second part is like the word 良い (good). So, you can think of a <vocabulary>honorable</vocabulary>person eating soggy cereal. They're so gracious that it doesn't matter to them how soggy it is. In fact, they accept it with dignity! They keep saying \"it's soggy... 良い!\" over and over again while eating the terribly soggy food.",
