  "primaryReading": "いちがつ",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 月 has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the がつ reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\n<vocabulary>January</vocabulary> always gives you <reading>itchy</reading> <reading>guts</reading> (いちがつ). It's a weird affliction that comes around every January and makes your guts incredibly itchy. Probably due to all that overindulgence over the new year.\n",
