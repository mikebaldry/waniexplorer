To remember this word's reading we'll use a mnemonic.\n\nWhat are you doing going up into the <vocabulary>mountain</vocabulary>s? You're hunting for <reading>yam</reading>s (やま). Go ahead, imagine yourself doing just that, climbing up the mountain (it's hard work!) and then digging in the ground with your hands, then pulling up that sweet, delicious yam! Mmm!",
