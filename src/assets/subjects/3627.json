When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You put on the <vocabulary>ring</vocabulary> you found, hoping it will be the one ring to rule them all (invisibility!). Instead, it turns out it's a special <reading>Wa</reading>lken(わ) ring, made out of Christopher Walken's bones. It talks up to you, telling you how he kept this ring in his (*ahem*) butt during the war so he could get it to you. First of all, why is this ring talking? Second, why is it talking like Walken. Third, eww, gross, it was in his anus.",
