The radical is <radical>sword</radical>, but we're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese <kanji>sword</kanji>? That's right, the most common is a <kanji>katana</kanji>, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.",

To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to <reading>とう</reading>きょう (Tokyo). とうきょう has the best sword and katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to とうきょう.",
