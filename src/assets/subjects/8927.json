  "primaryMeaning": "To Get Better",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji 治 means <kanji>cure</kanji>, but this verb refers to the natural process of getting better: <vocabulary>to get better</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to get well</vocabulary>, or simply <vocabulary>to heal</vocabulary>. This is an intransitive verb, meaning that it happens on its own. Nobody cures you, you just get better.",
  "primaryReading": "なおる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nWhen you get sick, your mom calls every day to ask, \"Are you better <reading>now</reading> (なお)?\" How about NOW!? How about NOW!? Jeez Mom, just let me rest!",
