In other words, an <vocabulary>unexpected incident</vocabulary> or an <vocabulary>unusual incident</vocabulary>.\n\n変事 is a formal word used to describe sudden and unusual occurrences that disrupt normal conditions, such as natural disasters, emergencies, or crises. You won't see this word often, but may still come across it in formal writing.\n\nWith 変事, think of how the 変 comes first to emphasize the strangeness of the incident. ",
