  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>walk</kanji> so the verb version means <vocabulary>to walk</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "あるく",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the ある portion. Imagine yourself going <vocabulary>to walk</vocabulary> outside. But, as you walk, you walk like a pirate. You have a peg leg, a parrot, and a hook. Lastly, you say \"<reading>arrrrr</reading>\" (ある). Go ahead, say it out loud while walking around your room like a pirate. It will help.",
