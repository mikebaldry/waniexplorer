Sheep don’t have hands, so the sheep had to pick the horns up off the ground with his mouth. Someone evil would just murder the sheep and steal his horns, so the sheep must find someone <kanji>good</kanji> to reaffix them.",

Your Zen teachings have increased the power of your healing abilities, so you fix the sheep up in no time.",
