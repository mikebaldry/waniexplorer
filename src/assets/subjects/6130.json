  "primaryMeaning": "To Embrace",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>hug</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to embrace</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to hold</vocabulary> (in one's arms, that is). It can also mean <vocabulary>to hug</vocabulary>, especially in the form of 抱きしめる.\n\nKeep in mind that depending on the context, 抱く can be a euphemism for something way more sexual than just hugging. Not always, of course, but pretty often, so just be careful how you use it! 抱きしめる is the better option if you're talking about regular old hugs.",
  "primaryReading": "だく",
  "readingMnemonic": "What are you going <vocabulary>to embrace</vocabulary>? How about your <reading>da</reading>d (だ)? Or if he's not around, maybe an <reading>e</reading>-<reading>da</reading>d (いだ)? You know, like a digital version of a dad.\n\nThe two readings for this word have different nuances. だく is more for physical holding and hugging, as in 赤ちゃんを抱く (to hold a baby). But when it's something you hold in your heart, like an emotion or feeling, use the いだく reading: 疑問を抱く (to hold doubts) or 夢を抱く (to have a dream), for example.",
