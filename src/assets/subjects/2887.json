The nicer, more politically correct version of the word is the one above. An <kanji>outside</kanji> <kanji>country</kanji> <kanji>person</kanji>. To differentiate this from \"foreigner\" we're going to use the more polite English version of this word as well (just like in Japanese): <vocabulary>Foreign Person</vocabulary>.",

That's right, they'll be in <reading>jean</reading>s (じん)!",
