  "primaryMeaning": "Therefore",
  "meaningMnemonic": "You learned that 故 means reason. Basically, whatever comes before 故に in a statement is going to be the reason for something that comes after. So 故に works like <vocabulary>therefore</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>consequently</vocabulary>. It can also be translated as \"because\" or other similar conjunctions depending on the context.\n\nAlso keep in mind that 故に is mainly used in formal contexts, like in academic writing or politicians' speeches — just like \"therefore\" in English.",
  "primaryReading": "ゆえに",
  "readingMnemonic": "By knowing the word 故 you'll know the reading for this word too! Here's a mnemonic in case you need a reminder, though:\n\nYou're using WaniKani, <vocabulary>therefore</vocabulary> you're studying kanji and vocab. Whose fault is it? It's WaniKani's fault! But, your brain has been beaten to a mush from all the studying, so when you say \"it's your fault\" it comes out as \"it's <reading>yue</reading> fault!\" Go ahead and say it out loud that way.",
