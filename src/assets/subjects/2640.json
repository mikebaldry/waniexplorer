  "meaningMnemonic": "This word starts with お which makes it more polite. Then, there's the kanji <kanji>母</kanji> which you know means mother. Last, there's the honorific さん which further adds respect (to the mother). So, this is the nice way to say <vocabulary>mother</vocabulary>. You use it when you're talking to your own <vocabulary>mom</vocabulary> or talking about her with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' moms.\n\nIf you need to talk about someone's mother that you don't really know, or you aren't close to, you'll want to use お母様, instead. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, おかあさま. Kay?",
  "primaryReading": "おかあさん",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You have to remember the かあ portion. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it: \n\nWhat does your super nice <vocabulary>mother</vocabulary> do for you (this is why you're so polite to her!)? She drives you all around in her <reading>car</reading> (かあ) taking you wherever you need to go... soccer, kendo, whatever. What a nice mother you have!\n",
