  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>astray</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to go astray</vocabulary> (because you don't just \"to astray\" now do you?). You can use it if you ever happen <vocabulary>to get lost</vocabulary>. \n\nBeyond physically getting lost, 迷う is also for times when you waver between different choices or hesitate to take a decisive step.",
  "primaryReading": "まよう",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you are going <vocabulary>to go astray</vocabulary>, one way to do it would be to eat wayyyy too much <reading>mayo</reading> (まよ). I can't think of a worse way to go astray, personally.",
