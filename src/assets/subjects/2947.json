You step out, and you're surprised because you get greeted by an old Canadian man. <reading>Sue, eh?</reading>(すえ) he asks you, over and over. The poor man is looking for his wife Sue, and he's searched to the end of the universe. That's true love. As he walks off into the distance, you hear him calling out, \"Sue, eh? Sue, eh? Sue, eh?\" ",
