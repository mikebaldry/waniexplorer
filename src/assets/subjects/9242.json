  "meaningMnemonic": "At the <kanji>present time</kanji> you're providing a <kanji>service</kanji>, so you're <vocabulary>actively working</vocabulary>. 現役 means you have a certain role (such as school teacher or a high school student, etc.) and you're still <vocabulary>active</vocabulary> in that role, as opposed to being retired or having graduated.\n\nThis word is also often used to describe students who are taking or have passed a university entrance exam while they were still high school students.",
  "primaryReading": "げんえき",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You learned the readings for both of these, but 役 uses a less common reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this:\n\nYou're <vocabulary>actively working</vocabulary> at the <reading>駅</reading> (えき) and you plan to remain <vocabulary>active</vocabulary> there forever! You sure do love that 駅, it's like you're inseparable.",
