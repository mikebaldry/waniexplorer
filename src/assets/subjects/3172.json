  "meaningMnemonic": "You know the kanji here means <kanji>revolve</kanji>. The verb version of this is similar. It means <vocabulary>to roll</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to tumble</vocabulary>. You have to be revolving in order to roll or tumble, right? <ja>転がる</ja> is intransitive, so it doesn't take a direct object. A ball rolls down a hill. A tumbleweed tumbles. No direct object, right?\n\nVerbs ending in okurigana that rhyme with <ja>ある</ja> tend to be intransitive like this. You can remember this because if something is <ja>ある</ja>, it's just there, existing, not acting <em>on</em> anything else. That's why verbs that sound like it are often intransitive too!",
  "primaryReading": "ころがる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhat should you do when you want <vocabulary>to roll</vocabulary> down a hill? Become a bottle of <reading>Coro</reading>na (ころ). Just imagine yourself as a bottle of Corona, rolling down a hill. You're a Corona bottle, so you roll super easily. Now feel the grass under your glass as you roll down that hill. Nice, isn't it?",
