To do that, imagine seeing that the <vocabulary>subjects</vocabulary> you're allowed to take next term are different than everyone else's. The other kids notice, and start <reading>mock</reading>ing (もく) you for it. Think of what those subjects are and how you're being mocked for having to take them.",
