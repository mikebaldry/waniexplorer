  "primaryReading": "せがたかい",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). You've learned both of these readings before now, so you should be able to read this word already!",
