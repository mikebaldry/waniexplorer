  "meaningMnemonic": "This isn't a literal <kanji>snake</kanji>'s <kanji>mouth</kanji>, but rather a <vocabulary>faucet</vocabulary>. They do kind of have a resemblance though, just think about how the shape of a faucet kind of resembles that of a snake, with water coming out of its mouth.",
  "primaryReading": "じゃぐち",
  "readingMnemonic": "This one's a little unique, as it uses on'yomi for 蛇, and kun'yomi (which gets rendaku'd) for 口. You didn't learn this reading for 蛇, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nEvery time you try to drink from the <vocabulary>faucet</vocabulary>, you get viciously attacked by a <reading>ja</reading>guar (じゃ). Trying to drink from the faucet has become a fight for life and death. You just know the jaguar is hiding right there behind the faucet, guarding it.",
