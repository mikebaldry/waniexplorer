  "primaryMeaning": "Not So Good",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Something that's both <kanji>delicate</kanji> and <kanji>peculiar</kanji> is probably <vocabulary>not so good</vocabulary>. It's not terrible, but it's not great either — it could break easily, plus it's kind of strange… It's <vocabulary>not really</vocabulary> good, you know? Think of 微妙 as a sort of euphemism for those delicate and peculiar things you're not really into. \n\n微妙 can also just mean <vocabulary>delicate</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>subtle</vocabulary>, like 微妙な立場 (a delicate position that requires careful handling) or 微妙なニュアンスの違い (a subtle nuance difference that's hard to pinpoint).",
  "primaryReading": "びみょう",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
