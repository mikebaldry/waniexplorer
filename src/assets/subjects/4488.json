  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>sleep</kanji> or <kanji>lie down</kanji>, so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to sleep</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to lie down</vocabulary>—just like what you do when you decide <vocabulary>to go to bed</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "ねる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji. So, you can go ahead and lie down for a moment before moving on to the next item.",
