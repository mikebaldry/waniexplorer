  "primaryMeaning": "To Let Something Pass",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that 通る means to pass, but this is a little different. You aren't the one passing, Sue (す) is. So you have to let Sue pass. In other words, this verb is transitive, meaning it has an object. That's why it means <vocabulary>to let something pass</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put something through</vocabulary>.\n\nThe way this verb is translated into English changes a lot depending on the noun it's paired with. For example 火を通す is literally \"to let the fire pass through\", and means \"to heat through\". 針に糸を通す is literally \"to put thread through a needle\", so means \"to thread a needle\".",
  "primaryReading": "とおす",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned 通る. Switch the る for a す and you'll be all set!",
