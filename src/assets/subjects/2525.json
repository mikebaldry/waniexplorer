To remember this word, think of it this way:\n\nYou have <vocabulary>five things</vocabulary>. What do you have to do with them? You need to <reading>eat</reading> (いつ) them. Just imagine having five delicious things to eat, sticking each on one finger of your hand, and then eating them one after another. And make sure to count down from five while doing it!",
