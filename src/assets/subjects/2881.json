When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nTell me about your <vocabulary>country</vocabulary>. Now imagine that everyone in your country has <reading>coo</reading>l <reading>knee</reading>s (くに). That's because the national dress code is shorts, so everyone's knees get chilly. That why they have cool knees. You could also imagine cool knees in the sense of trendy knees. What makes for cool knees, in your opinion?",
