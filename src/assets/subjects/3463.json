  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Mixed",
  "meaningMnemonic": "You know that 交ぜる means <vocabulary>to mix</vocabulary> and that the kanji means <kanji>mix</kanji> as well. So, this probably has something to do with mixing things. This word means <vocabulary>to be mixed</vocabulary>. This is when something is mixed but it's not mixed by you. It's just being mixed. Think of it this way - the じ in 交じる is Jesus, who just uses Jesus magic to mix something. So, you're not mixing it. It's just when something is <vocabulary>to be mixed</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "まじる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as with 交ぜる. So long as you know the ま portion of that word's reading, you'll be able to read this word as well.",
