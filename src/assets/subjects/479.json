It’s sunny, the trees smell nice (imagine a tree smell if you can – the more senses you use the better!) and on that tree there is an awesome tire <reading>swi</reading>ng (すい). You get onto the tire swing and you are swinging back and forth. The water is right in front of you, and you are able to use the swing to throw yourself into the water. It’s a lot colder than you expected, and you come back to the surface, gasping for breath. The water gets into your mouth and you taste it. How strange, it’s very, very <reading>swee</reading>t. Imagine the sweetness of the water and how weird it is (really really sweet, this water is).",
