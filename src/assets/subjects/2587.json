  "primaryMeaning": "To Stand Something Up",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means \"stand\" and this means <vocabulary>to stand something up</vocabulary>. It also can mean <vocabulary>to make something</vocabulary>, both in a physical sense, like making a sound, and a mental sense, like making a plan. \n\nDon't confuse this with 立つ. 立てる means that you're standing something up. As in, \"I stood up the action figure\" or \"I will erect the flag.\" You're doing the action to something else.",
  "primaryReading": "たてる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned the kun'yomi reading for this kanji with 立つ, so you should be good to go!",
