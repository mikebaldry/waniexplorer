It's the <vocabulary>light</vocabulary>!\n\nNow you might wonder: how is this different from 光 (ひかり)? 光 is more general, and often used specifically for sunlight. 明かり often refers to some specific source of light, like the kind that illuminates a room, so it's often used for light that comes from lamps.",
