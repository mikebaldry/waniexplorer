  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\n\nNote: You'll sometimes hear people say ふいんき, but if you wrote that on a test you'd be marked wrong, so we're sticking with the more standard ふんいき reading. If you need help remembering it, just look a little closer at the kanji — you'll know 雰 is ふん because it gets its reading from the little 分 inside it!",
