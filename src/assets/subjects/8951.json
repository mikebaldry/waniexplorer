  "primaryMeaning": "To Lack Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>lack</kanji>, and this verb means <vocabulary>to lack something</vocabulary>. Pretty simple in English, but 欠く is actually kind of advanced and formal in Japanese, so it's mostly just used in writing. \n\nAlso keep in mind this is a transitive verb, so 欠く takes a direct object — maybe someone lacks <em>knowledge</em>, for example, or you lack <em>concentration</em>. This is a bit different from saying \"your concentration is lacking,\" at least grammatically. (For that, you'd use 欠ける.)",
  "primaryReading": "かく",
  "readingMnemonic": "You learned this reading when you learned 欠ける, but here's a mnemonic just in case:\n\nYou never know when you're going <vocabulary>to lack something</vocabulary>. Like a <reading>ca</reading>r (か). Did you plan for it to break? NO! But it happened and now you lack a car in a big way. Not <reading>cool</reading> (く)!",
