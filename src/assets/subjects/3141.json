  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nWhere you're from, every <vocabulary>beautiful woman</vocabulary> wears <reading>bee</reading> <reading>jean</reading>s (びじん). That's right, jeans made out of bees. Beauty knows no pain after all!",
