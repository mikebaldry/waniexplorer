  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>transit</kanji>. It's also in the verb 渡る, which means \"to cross.\" But with 渡す, it's more like you're sending something across instead, usually to another person. So 渡す means <vocabulary>to hand over</vocabulary>.\n\nIt can also mean <vocabulary>to ferry something across</vocabulary> a river, or <vocabulary>to lay something across</vocabulary> an expanse, like when you lay a plank over a pothole or build a bridge across a river.\n\nTo remember the す in 渡す, think of suing someone. When you <reading>sue</reading> (す) them, you have to hand over the papers to let them know you're suing. If you don't 渡す the papers, you can't sue!",
