  "primaryMeaning": "Pluralizing Suffix",
  "meaningMnemonic": "You'll see this attached to other words to make them <kanji>plural</kanji>. That's why it's called a <vocabulary>pluralizing suffix</vocabulary>. \n\nNote that you can only attach this to people and animals to make them plural. It can also be used with a person's name, like マリアたち. In that case, it refers to Maria and the group of people she's with! This might sound a little complicated, but you'll get the hang of it with a little practice!",
  "primaryReading": "たち",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is almost the same reading you learned with the kanji. Remember たつ? Well this is read たち. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nIf you want to pluralize something, <reading>touch</reading> (たち) it to something else. One friend touches another friend, well now they're friends. Plural friends! All thanks to the good ol' pluralizing suffix touch!\n\nOh, and don't type the 〜 out when writing the answer. It's just there to let you know that there's usually something attached in front of this word.",
