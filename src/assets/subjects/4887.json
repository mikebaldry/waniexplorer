  "primaryReading": "ふたたび",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\n<vocabulary>Once again</vocabulary>, you have to say \"<reading>Who</reading>? <reading>Ta</reading>-<reading>ta</reading>!\" (ふたた). That's because people you don't know keep trying to talk to you, <vocabulary>again</vocabulary> and again. Whenever this happens you say \"Who? Ta-ta!\" again and run away.",
