You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to till</vocabulary> your land because you want to have a <reading>tige</reading>r <reading>ya</reading>rd (たがや). That's either when you have a yard full of live tigers, or you plant bushes and shape them into tigers. I hope it's the second kind of tiger yard. Either way, you have to plow the land to get it ready.",
