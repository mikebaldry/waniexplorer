I'm not entirely sure either, but an adjective with movement in it is a <vocabulary>na adjective</vocabulary>. These are the adjectives that can end with な (便利な, for example). In fact, they're more like nouns than they are verbs, so what gives? Whatever it is, just decide you don't want to deal with this craziness. Just say <reading>nah</reading>, I don't care about this anymore.",

  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. It will help to know 形容詞 and 動詞 as well, since they're both parts of this word.",
