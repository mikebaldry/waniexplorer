  "primaryReading": "うりて",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too! One hint that this is a kun'yomi reading word is the hiragana in the center. It's like two separate words combined together, and when a word is a single kanji / a single kanji with hiragana attached it is usually kun'yomi. This is like two of those, combined.",
