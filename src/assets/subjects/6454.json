It can mean <vocabulary>to refrain</vocabulary> from drinking, <vocabulary>to hold back</vocabulary>  comments, or <vocabulary>to stand by</vocabulary> (abstaining from taking action). In some contexts, it can even mean \"to take a memo\" because memo-taking is like putting information on standby!",
