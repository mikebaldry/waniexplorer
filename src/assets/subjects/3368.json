  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\n球 has a slightly technical sound and highlights the sphere shape of the object you're talking about. It's most commonly used to refer to <vocabulary>sports ball</vocabulary>s (as a more formal alternative to ボール).",
  "primaryReading": "たま",
  "readingMnemonic": "This word is made up of a single kanji, so it should use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou see a <vocabulary>sphere</vocabulary> in <reading>Tama</reading>ra's (たま) hand. You're not totally sure what it is, but it's really spherical. Maybe it's some kind of <vocabulary>sports ball</vocabulary>. Remember Tamara, the local ball girl? It would totally make sense for Tamara to be holding either a sphere or a sports ball, since that's kind of all she does.\n\nYou might notice 球 has the same reading as the vocab word 玉. Their meanings are kind of similar too, so this reading should be a bit easier to remember!",
