You think learning Japanese is hard now, just wait till you hear Osaka-ben and Hokkaido-ben. It takes a really strong person — a Benkei — to learn all those dialects, so congratulate them and tell them how strong they are!\n\n弁慶 is the name of a Japanese historical figure who was really strong, so Benkei is the Japanese equivalent of Hercules or Achilles in Western languages.",
