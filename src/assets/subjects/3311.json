  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember:\n\nA <vocabulary>good</vocabulary> way to pass the time is with a <reading>yo</reading>-yo (よ). But it better be a good yo-yo. A bad one will just fall apart.\n\nNote that よい is a more formal or literary way of saying \"good,\" the more common one being いい. To distinguish the different readings, the latter version is usually written in just kana too!",
