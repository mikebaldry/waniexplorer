  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Fixed",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>fix</kanji>, so the verb <ja>直る</ja> is similar to that: <vocabulary>to be fixed</vocabulary>. \n\n直る is intransitive, so it doesn't take a direct object. In other words: don't use it to say \"I fixed it,\" but do use it to say \"It's fixed!\" Imagine a British person excitedly shouting, \"My loo (る) was broken, but now it's fixed!\"",
  "primaryReading": "なおる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou have to learn the <ja>なお</ja> part. Think of it this way. Something needs <vocabulary>to be fixed</vocabulary>. It's urgent! It has to be fixed <reading>now</reading>! (<ja>なお</ja>).",
