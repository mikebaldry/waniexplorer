  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You already know the on'yomi for 温, but not for 厚, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nThe most <vocabulary>mild-mannered</vocabulary> Tofugu staff has to be <reading>on</reading>ion <reading>こう</reading>いち. It's an onion that jumps in for こういち whenever he's not at the office. He's the most <vocabulary>gentle</vocabulary> soul you could imagine, never yelling at anyone. The ideal boss, really.",
