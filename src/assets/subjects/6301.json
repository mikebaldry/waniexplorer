  "primaryMeaning": "To Bury",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>bury</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to bury</vocabulary> as well.\n\n埋める can also mean <vocabulary>to fill</vocabulary>, and can refer to filling a hole, vacancy, or gap. Note that this word can be used to refer to filling in figurative holes and gaps too, like a hole in one’s finances!",
  "primaryReading": "うめる",
  "readingMnemonic": "You learned this reading with the kanji, how nice for you!\n\nHowever, you might notice that in addition to うめる, there's another reading too: うずめる. うめる is used for the act of burying something or filling in a hole, while うずめる is used when describing the covering or concealment of something, or when burying one's face in something (like a fluffy cat!)",
