  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>dangle</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to dangle</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to dangle something</vocabulary>. You're doing the dangling.",

  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhat are you trying <vocabulary>to dangle</vocabulary>? You're dangling a <reading>ta</reading>co (た) in front of a hungry person. He just wants the taco, and you keep dangling it like that.",
