The kanji itself means <kanji>tired</kanji>, so the verb version means <vocabulary>to get tired</vocabulary>. \n\n疲れる refers to a physical or mental kind of tiredness, like you just worked out or studied a ton, but isn't used to describe sleepiness.",
  "primaryReading": "つかれる",
  "readingMnemonic": "For example, you're bound <vocabulary>to get tired</vocabulary> if you try to lift <reading>two ca</reading>rs (つか), right? So think about that as you learn this word's reading.",
