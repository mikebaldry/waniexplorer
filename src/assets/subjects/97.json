  "meaningMnemonic": "The <radical>samurai</radical> radical looks a lot like the dirt radical. The difference is in the top horizontal line. For samurai, the top is longer because he's holding swords. Dirt can't really hold anything because its arms are too short. So when you see this radical, think: long arms for some long swords. That's a samurai!",
