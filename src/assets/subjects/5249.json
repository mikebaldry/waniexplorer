  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. When <kanji>append</kanji>ing something, you basically want <vocabulary>to add something to</vocabulary> something, or <vocabulary>to include something</vocabulary> with it. \n\n添える means to add something alongside the main thing, often as a thoughtful touch to complement or support it. For example, you might say 添える when including a letter with a gift to add a personal touch, or when garnishing a dish with parsley to enhance its appearance. It's also used when you feel inclined to add a second hand to hold a bowl carefully.",

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: One way <vocabulary>to add something to</vocabulary> something else is to just <reading>sew</reading> (そ) it on!",
