  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou know what's <vocabulary>unusual</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>rare</vocabulary>? This <reading>maze</reading> is <reading>ra</reading>re (めずら). I don't think there's a way out of it. We've been walking around for days now, and we haven't gotten any closer to the exit!",
