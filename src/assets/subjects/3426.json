  "primaryMeaning": "Phonetic Kanji",
  "meaningMnemonic": "当てる means \"to guess\" or \"to hit\", and 字 means <kanji>letter</kanji>. So these are guessed letters? Kind of, they're so-called <vocabulary>phonetic kanji</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>ateji</vocabulary>.\n\nThis refers to cases where kanji are used solely for their sound, but not their meaning. There are also some cases of ateji where kanji are used only for their meaning and not their sound, but this is less common. ",
  "primaryReading": "あてじ",
  "readingMnemonic": "The readings are the kun'yomi reading for 当て and the on'yomi reading for 字. You've seen 当てる in the past, so you should be able to read this portion as well. Combine the two together and you have yourself a nice reading.",
