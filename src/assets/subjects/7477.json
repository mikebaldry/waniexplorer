That's why this verb is <vocabulary>to add something</vocabulary>, because you keep adding things until you 足りる.\n\nThis verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in す, which is why you are adding something. It's not getting itself added all by itself. Maybe you add so much that someone tries to <reading>sue</reading> (す) you for that nasty pile of squirrels you keep outside.",
