When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n\nYou see a child and walk up to him. Then, you punch him in the face (oh no, how could you!!?). He flies through the air, and he's knocked out. A ref nearby yells that it was a \"<reading>KO</reading>!\" (こ). That's a knock out.\n\nMake sure you learn this reading pretty well too. Both readings for 子 are going to show up a lot, and this is how you're going to learn the kun'yomi one.",
