  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n\nYou saw a <vocabulary>child</vocabulary> and gave her your <reading>co</reading>at (こ). The kid looked all cold, so you gave her your coat. Children never want to wear proper warm clothing when they should, then they end up shivering their butts off and needing to wear a parent's oversized coat. Fortunately you were there to give this 子 your coat.",
