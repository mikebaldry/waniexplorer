While it might sound a bit old-fashioned, you can still use it to describe something heavenly. For example, if you're soaking in a cozy, relaxing hot spring, you could say, \"Ahhh…極楽!\"",
  "primaryReading": "ごくらく",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. 極 has two on'yomi readings, though. So here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nIn <vocabulary>paradise</vocabulary>, you meet <reading>Goku</reading> (ごく) from Dragon Ball Z. He grins and tells you he's taking a break from extreme battles and enjoying the extreme comfort of this heavenly paradise.",
