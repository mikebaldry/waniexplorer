  "meaningMnemonic": "この means \"this\", and you know what the word 前  means (front/before). The combination of these words, \"this before\" if you will, can mean a few different things. If we're talking about when something happened, the \"before\" meaning kicks in, and it means <vocabulary>the other day</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>recently</vocabulary>. If we're talking about location, then the \"front\" meaning kicks in, and it means <vocabulary>in front of this</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "このまえ",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for 前 is the kun'yomi, like the reading for the vocabulary word 前. So long as you know that word, you'll be able to read this one too. The reason it's not on'yomi is because it's like two words put together. The word この and the word 前.",
