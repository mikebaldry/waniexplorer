  "primaryMeaning": "To Smoke",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>suck</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to suck</vocabulary>, but it's usually used to talk about what you do to cigarettes, so a better translation I think is <vocabulary>to smoke</vocabulary>.",
  "primaryReading": "すう",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou smoke too much, and that gives you cancer. You decide to <reading>sue</reading> (す) the cigarette makers.",
