  "primaryMeaning": "To Indicate",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>indicate</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to indicate</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to show</vocabulary>. This is used in contexts like \"a study shows that learning Japanese is fun\" and \"I demonstrated my willingness to learn kanji\".",
  "primaryReading": "しめす",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nStudies seem <vocabulary>to indicate</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to show</vocabulary> that <reading>shee</reading>p <reading>me</reading>n (しめ) are better than regular men in every way. The sheep/man combo is a powerful thing. Or so studies indicate.",
