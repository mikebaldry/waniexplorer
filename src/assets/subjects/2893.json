  "meaningMnemonic": "The お makes the word more polite. You're elevating the \"<vocabulary>older sister</vocabulary>\" title because you're a good younger sibling. Otherwise, the meaning of this word is the same as the kanji - just the feeling is different. You can also use this word to refer to a youthful-looking woman that you don't know, as in \"Excuse me <vocabulary>miss</vocabulary>!\" ",
  "primaryReading": "おねえさん",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is different too. It has some hiragana attached to it, which is a clue that this uses a kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to learn that reading. \n\nImagine your <vocabulary>older sister</vocabulary> (even if you don't have one). She is, for some reason, a horse. Imagine petting her, giving her carrots, and doing other horse-related things with her. What do horses say? They say <reading>nehhhh</reading> (ねえ).",
