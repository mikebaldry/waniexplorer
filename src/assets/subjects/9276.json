  "primaryMeaning": "To Occur",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Remember how 生まれる means \"to be born\"? This word is similar, but it's used for when non-living things are \"born\". So as an intransitive verb, this means <vocabulary>to occur</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to arise</vocabulary>. When used transitively, it means <vocabulary>to cause something</vocabulary>. You'll probably encounter the intransitive use much more, though.",
  "primaryReading": "しょうじる",
  "readingMnemonic": "You'd think this would use kun'yomi, but it actually doesn't! Like other verbs ending in じる, this takes the on'yomi reading of the kanji. 生 has two of those, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use: \n\nIf you wanted anything <vocabulary>to occur</vocabulary> in medieval Japan, you needed to talk to the <reading>Shou</reading>gun. You always needed the Shougun's help <vocabulary>to cause something</vocabulary>. Without the Shougun, nothing would ever happen!",
