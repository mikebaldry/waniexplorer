That's why you have to replace flowers on tombstones all the time. If you don't it will look like you only left the stems there, and that's pretty disrespectful.",

Cookies don't fall apart in the wind, and everyone loves cookies, alive or dead. You replace the stems with the cookies and everything looks a lot nicer.",
