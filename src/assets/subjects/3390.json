The げ part for 気 is a bit of an exception, so here's a mnemonic to help with that:\n\nNo creature likes <vocabulary>steam</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>vapor</vocabulary> more than <reading>ge</reading>ckos (げ). Geckos live in hot places, so wherever you see steam, you'll be sure to see at least one gecko nearby, if you look hard enough.",
