Note this uses the alternative と reading, not to be confused with とう (actually, very confusing, sorry!). Just imagine you cut your <reading>toe</reading> off with an ice pick while mountain climbing. You know it's a short と because your toe is now short. And さん becomes ざん thanks to our old friend rendaku.",
