  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Reflected",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>reflect</kanji>. The verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to be reflected</vocabulary>. You're not doing the reflecting directly. You can remember this by thinking how rude (る) it is that someone's reflecting your image using a mirror for everyone outside the dressing room to see.",
  "primaryReading": "うつる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYour reflection is getting reflected onto the mirror. You don't like it, it doesn't look like you. Impostor reflection! You take a hammer and you <reading>打つ</reading> (うつ) it as hard as you can, glass flying everywhere. Then some dubstep starts playing from the broken mirror: <reading>うつ</reading>うつうつうつ. \n\nYou might recall that this reading is the same as <reading>写</reading>る and might wonder if they're related. They are! They both talk about the image of something showing up somewhere else, and use different kanji to distinguish where. In 写る's case, that would typically be in photographs, and for 映る, it's in reflections or projections (which includes the contents of screens, like those of TVs or computers). ",
