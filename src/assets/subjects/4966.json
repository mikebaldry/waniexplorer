  "primaryMeaning": "To Touch",
  "meaningMnemonic": "触る means \"to touch,\" and 触れる also means <vocabulary>to touch</vocabulary>. The word also means <vocabulary>to touch on</vocabulary>, as in touching on some subject. Just think of a subject that is <reading>rare</reading> (れる) for you to want to touch on.\n\n触れる is often for when something happens <vocabulary>to come into contact with</vocabulary> something, possibly in a fleeting or momentary way. It's still used in phrases like \"When I touched your hand,\" but has a lighter, more indirect and literary feel than 触る, which conveys a greater sense of purpose and intent behind the action.\n\n触れる is often used in constructions like 手がカバンに触れる (one's hand touches a bag), where が indicates what's doing the touching and に marks what's being touched. If you see を instead of が, 触れる becomes transitive, changing the meaning to \"to have your hand touch a bag.\"",
  "primaryReading": "ふれる",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is totally different from 触る so don't let that fool you. In this case, you feel some <reading>fur</reading> (ふれ).",
