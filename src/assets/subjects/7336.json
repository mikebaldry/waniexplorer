  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>watered</kanji>. When something is watered it becomes moist, right? That's why this verb is <vocabulary>to be moist</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be moistened</vocabulary>.\n\n潤う refers to things being well-moisturized, like skin or eyes. Think of them as being enriched with moisture. That's why the meaning also extends to financial prosperity — moisture enriches the body, and financial gain enriches your life or business. So this word also means <vocabulary>to be prosperous</vocabulary>.",
