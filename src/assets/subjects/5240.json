  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n\n板 generally refers to something thin, flat, and solid, like a board, plank, slab, or plate. In some contexts, it can also refer to stock market boards that display trading prices, or bulletin boards used for posting messages in online forums.",
  "primaryReading": "いた",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWho can make good use of various <vocabulary>board</vocabulary>s? An avid <reading>eater</reading> (いた)! If you’re an avid eater, you’ll need lots of (cutting) boards to prepare all the delicious food you’re going to eat. This makes boards and eaters the perfect match.",
