  "primaryMeaning": "To Be Renewed",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>renew</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be renewed</vocabulary>. Like most verbs ending in まる, this is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn't take a direct object. Something renews or gets renewed, or something changes. See? No direct object.\n\nAlthough it's not often translated as \"renew,\" 改まる implies a kind of renewal in the changes it's used to describe — whether it's the revision of regulations or the old year changing over to a new one. It can also be used for personal improvements, or describe a shift to a more formal demeanor in social situations.",
  "primaryReading": "あらたまる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You might remember this reading from the transitive verb 改める, but here's a mnemonic just in case: \n\n<vocabulary>To be renewed</vocabulary> means to be changed into something <reading>新た</reading> (あらた). Out with the old, in with the 新た, right? Picture yourself in a situation where there's been a lot of change. Try to remember how it feels when everything is 新た. Are you nervous, excited, or do you usually move on without noticing?",
