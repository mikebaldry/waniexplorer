  "meaningMnemonic": "If you go to (ごと) a <kanji>circle</kanji>, you need to go to it <vocabulary>in its entirety</vocabulary>. That means you have to circle around the <vocabulary>whole</vocabulary> thing. Otherwise, it isn't even a circle. It's like a line or a squiggle or something.\n\nYou often hear this word when talking about food – like when biting into a whole apple or accidentally swallowing a grape without chewing. But it's not just for food: you can also use it to talk about memorizing a whole book from beginning to end, for example.",
  "primaryReading": "まるごと",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading, so you should be able to read this too!",
