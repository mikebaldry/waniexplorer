When there were no glass windows, the shutters were simply like exterior doors in Japan, so \"rain door\" kind of makes sense as \"shutter\"! \n\nThis word is usually for <vocabulary>sliding storm shutter</vocabulary>s. For other types of shutters, you can just say シャッター.",
  "primaryReading": "あまど",
  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, but it actually uses kun'yomi for both 雨 and 戸. Additionally, the reading for 雨 is actually slightly different from what you've learned, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nHave you ever thought a <vocabulary>shutter</vocabulary> is like an <reading>armor</reading> (あま) for a window? They're both protections, and are usually made from metal. Kind of makes sense, right?",
