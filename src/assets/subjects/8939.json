  "primaryMeaning": "To Advance Something",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>advance</kanji>, and this verb means <vocabulary>to advance something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to move something forward</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, so you act upon something else. You advance something. You move something forward. Like a school project, or your plans for taking over the world.",
  "primaryReading": "すすめる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help:\n\nYou are moving your lawsuit forward against Sue. But now she says that YOU'RE the problem. \"<reading>Sue, sue me</reading>,\" (すすめ) you say as you continue to advance the lawsuit. Make sure to say \"me\" like \"mehh,\" in a really snobbish way.",
