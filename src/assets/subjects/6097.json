  "readingMnemonic": "Bullets used to be round, so maybe that's why this vocab shares a たま reading with other words you've learned for round things, like 玉 and 球. Remember those?\n\nIf not, just imagine a <vocabulary>bullet</vocabulary> being grabbed out of the air by <reading>Tama</reading>ra (たま), the local ball girl. She heard there was a たま and mistook it for a ball, and now her hand is kinda messed up. Try not to repeat her mistake.",
