You'll have to learn it straight up, that is, unless you know the word おいしい already, which many people do as it's used in every other sentence in every Japanese variety show. If you don't know this word already, just think of yourself eating something <vocabulary>delicious</vocabulary>. It's so delicious it makes you mad, I have no idea why. You yell at the chef: \"<reading>OI</reading> (おい). OI! WHY IS THIS SO DELICIOUS????\"",
