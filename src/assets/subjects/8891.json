  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い all the way at the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. <kanji>Confused</kanji> is already an adjective and this word is a little different. Usually when you get confused it's because you were already <vocabulary>hurried</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>busy</vocabulary>, and things were <vocabulary>hectic</vocabulary>. So this adjective is what causes your confusion.",
  "primaryReading": "あわただしい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You've learned this reading, so you should be able to read this already!",
