  "primaryReading": "いわう",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nEveryone's here <vocabulary>to celebrate</vocabulary>, and all you can say is \"<reading>Eek, wha</reading>...!?\" (いわ). All your friends and family have come to celebrate your birthday, but you had no idea. Still confused and processing the situation, you keep saying, \"Eek... what?\" The surprise was a complete success!",
