  "primaryMeaning": "To Combine",
  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>concurrently</kanji>, but since you can't \"to concurrently\", we're going to have to come up with another word to use: \"<vocabulary>to combine</vocabulary>\" or \"<vocabulary>to double as</vocabulary>.\" Since this kanji has to do with something having a dual purpose, we can say that something can combine as being another thing, or double as being another thing, which is where these words come from.",
  "primaryReading": "かねる",
  "readingMnemonic": "For example, a <reading>ca</reading>r (か) can double as a place to sleep at night when not enough people become members of WaniKani.",
