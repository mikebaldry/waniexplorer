  "meaningMnemonic": "This word is made up of a single kanji with hiragana attached to it. That hiragana ends with い which means it's an adjective. So, what's the adjective form of the kanji that's in this word? 円 means both \"yen\" and \"round\" but in this case we're looking at the round one (because something isn't going to be \"yenny\"). The adjective version of round is <vocabulary>round</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>circular</vocabulary>. Just like a yen coin, this \"round\" is a flat round. As in, if you draw a circle on a piece of paper, you could use this word. Same goes with yen, which is why \"yen\" and \"round\" both use the same kanji.",
  "primaryReading": "まるい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe reading for the 円 portion of this word is the same as a kanji you learned on level 2: 丸. That kanji means something really similar to this kanji. And guess what? They also share a reading. So, if you know that the reading of 丸 is まる then you'll also know that the reading for this word is <reading>まる</reading>!",
