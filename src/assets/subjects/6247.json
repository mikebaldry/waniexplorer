  "primaryMeaning": "To Play A Stringed Instrument",
  "meaningMnemonic": "You'd think that this means \"to bullet\" but it does not. It means <vocabulary>to play a stringed instrument</vocabulary>. It's actually used for all stringed instruments, and all instruments with a keyboard, like pianos and electric keyboards. Just imagine taking a bullet and using it as a pick for a guitar, then using it to press down the keys of a piano and play a tune.",
  "primaryReading": "ひく",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as 引く, which is \"to pull.\" When you play a stringed instrument, you are pulling the string in a direction to make it vibrate and create a sound. So, \"to pull\" and \"to play a stringed instrument\" share a reading. It's a bit more of a stretch for instruments with keyboards, but pianos do at least have strings...",
