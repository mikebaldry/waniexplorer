When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nAll we need to shoot a <vocabulary>bow</vocabulary> is <reading>you 'n' me</reading> (ゆみ). One person holds the bow, the other fires the arrows. Teamwork makes the dream work. Even for shooting bows. Just you 'n' me.",
