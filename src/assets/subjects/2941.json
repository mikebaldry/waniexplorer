  "meaningMnemonic": "The kanji portion means <kanji>fault</kanji>, so you would think the verb version is \"to fault.\" It's a little different, though. Think of it this way, if you \"fault\" something, you're messing up. What's a great way to mess up? By losing something. That's why this word means <vocabulary>to lose</vocabulary>. \n\nPretend like you are supposed to hold on to someone's wedding ring. You make the biggest fault of all. You lose it. Ouch.",

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nSo how did you lose the wedding ring anyway? Well... it was eaten by a cow. The <reading>牛 now</reading> (うし + なう) has to have it surgically removed. What a mess!",
