  "meaningMnemonic": "This word starts with an お to make it more polite. Then it has the kanji <kanji>兄</kanji> which you already know. Lastly, it has さん which is an honorific to elevate people and be polite. This is basically the formal way of saying <vocabulary>older brother</vocabulary> (versus plain old 兄). It can also be used to refer to a <vocabulary>guy</vocabulary> that you don't know who has a youthful appearance. ",
  "primaryReading": "おにいさん",
  "readingMnemonic": "The reading for this one is pretty tricky, and I'd consider it an exception. To remember it, you have to learn the 兄 part, and everything else will fall into place. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYour (kind) <vocabulary>older brother</vocabulary> pushes you down on the ground. You stand up and look at your <reading>knee</reading> (にい), which is all bloody. \"Why'd you do that to my knee!?\" you ask. \"You're supposed to be a nice older brother, that's why I call you お兄さん!\"",
