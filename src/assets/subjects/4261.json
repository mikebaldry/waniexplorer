  "primaryMeaning": "To Knock Over",
  "meaningMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>overthrow</kanji> or <kanji>collapse</kanji>, and this is a transitive verb (like most verbs ending in す) related to those actions. It means <vocabulary>to knock over</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to bring down</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to defeat</vocabulary>.\n\nIt can be used to talk about physically knocking something over, as well as bringing something or someone down, like a government, or defeating someone, like an enemy.",
  "primaryReading": "たおす",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you want to knock over something, you'll have to go to <reading>tow</reading>n (たお) on it. You'll never be able to knock down anything if all your efforts are perfunctory. You really gotta go to town on that thing!",
