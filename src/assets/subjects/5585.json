  "meaningMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>dirty</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to get dirty</vocabulary>. You know you're not doing the dirtying, because it's <reading>rare</reading> (れる) for you to get anything dirty, though things do get dirty on their own.",
  "primaryReading": "よごれる",
  "readingMnemonic": "Things seem <vocabulary>to get dirty</vocabulary> easily around here, which is why <reading>you go</reading> (よご) to great lengths to keep things clean.\n\nNote that the reading よごれる is generally used for getting physically dirty, whereas けがれる is more figurative, so more like “to be defiled”.",
