  "meaningMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>old</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>old</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>ancient</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>out-of-date</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word is used for things like clothes, food and friendships, but not for people! So a 古い友人 (old friend) is someone you've been friends with for a long time, not an elderly friend.",
  "primaryReading": "ふるい",
  "readingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana attached, it's going to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi when learning the kanji portion, so let's use a mnemonic to help you with the reading of this word: \n\nIf you're <vocabulary>old</vocabulary>, you're also <reading>full</reading> (ふる) of memories. And you're probably full of old secrets. And you're full from old people food.",
