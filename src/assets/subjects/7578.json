Doing your hair and makeup in the morning supports your presentation to some extent, right? \n\nThis is another word for \"preparation\" besides 準備 and 用意. They’re all similar, but 支度 is usually used in personal contexts, such as 身支度 (getting dressed) or 旅支度 (getting ready for a trip).",

  "readingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 度 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember them together:\n\nIn <vocabulary>preparation</vocabulary> for getting sheared, a <reading>shee</reading>p will sit on a <reading>tack</reading> (したく). This sheep tacking makes it so that the shearing part is nothing! Imagine watching some sheep <vocabulary>getting ready</vocabulary> by sitting on tacks. Yikes. You want to tell them being sheared doesn't hurt and that sheep tacking is worse, but something makes you think they won't listen to you.",
